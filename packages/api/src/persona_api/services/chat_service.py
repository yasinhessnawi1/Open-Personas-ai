"""Conversation lifecycle + SSE chat (spec 08, T08, KEYSTONE 1).

The chat pathway: load the persona's conversation, drive
``ConversationLoop.turn`` (spec 05), stream its ``StreamChunk``s as SSE events,
and — only AFTER the final chunk — persist the new messages (incl. the
``channel`` passthrough, D-08-3), the compacted conversation state, the
``turn_log`` (T12), and the credits deduction (T12).

The persist-after-final discipline is load-bearing (research §3, D-05-12):
persistence runs in the normal flow after the generator's final yield, NEVER in
a ``finally`` — a client disconnect cancels the async generator mid-stream, and
a ``finally`` would persist a half-finished turn (state corruption). The async
generator simply suspends; persistence is skipped.

The ``ConversationLoop`` is built per-request by the runtime factory (T10),
which this service receives as an injected ``loop_builder`` so it stays testable
with a scripted backend.

    hosted E2B substrate — relative ``uploads/<name>`` from CWD). The built-in

    (:func:`persona_api.services.runtime_factory.RuntimeFactory._build_file_sandbox_root_provider`)
    — a *different* subtree from the conversation-scoped document store. Without

    This stages each document's bytes to

    document at the SAME relative path ``code_execution`` uses. The result is a
    single coherent path model — ``uploads/<filename>`` — across both tools.

    Isolation invariant (do NOT regress the just-landed security scoping): the
    target is resolved THROUGH :func:`resolve_sandbox_path` against the same
    per-(owner, persona) root file_read reads, so a pathological filename cannot
    escape the persona's subtree, and persona A never gains a path into persona
    B's (or another owner's) files. Only the CURRENT request's owner/persona
    root is ever written, and only the CURRENT conversation's attached
    documents (the ``documents`` already resolved for this turn).
