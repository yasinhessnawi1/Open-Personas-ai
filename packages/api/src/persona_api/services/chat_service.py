"""Conversation lifecycle + detached chat turns (spec 08 T08 + spec P1 T2b, KEYSTONE 1).

CRUD for conversations + the chat-turn entry points. Spec P1 reshaped the turn
from inline-streaming (persist-after-final) into a **detached, resumable
session** (D-P1-detached-execution):

- :func:`start_chat_turn` — persist the user message + an in-progress assistant
  row at turn START (``MessagesTurnSink.open_turn``), resolve images/documents,
  build the loop, and launch the turn as a detached background task via the
  ``ChatTurnRegistry``. A client disconnect no longer cancels the turn.
- :func:`stream_turn` — stream the live tail (events + chunks + the terminal
  ``done`` / ``error`` frame) from the turn's in-process queue. The SAME
  generator serves the originating POST and every reattach (T4).

The worker (``background.chat_turn_worker``) owns the during-turn checkpointing,
the terminal finalize, and the credits deduct on clean completion (the D-08-6
revision — bill regardless of client presence, D-P1-billing-contract). The old
persist-in-the-generator hazard is gone: persistence + billing live in the
detached task, so a mid-stream disconnect never loses the turn or skips the bill.

The ``ConversationLoop`` is built per-request by the runtime factory (T10),
injected as ``loop_builder`` so the flow stays testable with a scripted backend.

    The ``code_execution`` tool reads the documents staged onto
    ``deferred_input_files`` because the runtime ships those bytes into the
    REMOTE sandbox's working directory (``/home/user/uploads/<name>`` on the
    hosted E2B substrate — relative ``uploads/<name>`` from CWD). The built-in
    ``file_read`` tool, by contrast, reads the LOCAL filesystem under its
    per-request scoped root ``<workspace_root>/<owner_id>/<persona_id>``
    (:func:`persona_api.services.runtime_factory.RuntimeFactory._build_file_sandbox_root_provider`)
    — a *different* subtree from the conversation-scoped document store. Without
    this mirror, ``file_read("uploads/<name>")`` resolves to a path that does
    not exist and returns ``FileNotFoundError``.

    This stages each document's bytes to
    ``<workspace_root>/<owner_id>/<persona_id>/uploads/<filename>`` so a
    ``file_read("uploads/<filename>")`` finds THIS conversation's uploaded
    document at the SAME relative path ``code_execution`` uses. The result is a
    single coherent path model — ``uploads/<filename>`` — across both tools.

    Isolation invariant (do NOT regress the just-landed security scoping): the
    target is resolved THROUGH :func:`resolve_sandbox_path` against the same
    per-(owner, persona) root file_read reads, so a pathological filename cannot
    escape the persona's subtree, and persona A never gains a path into persona
    B's (or another owner's) files. Only the CURRENT request's owner/persona
    root is ever written, and only the CURRENT conversation's attached
    documents (the ``documents`` already resolved for this turn).

    Best-effort: a write failure is logged and skipped (the model still has the
    ``document_context`` synopsis + the ``code_execution`` copy); a partial
    staging beats a hard turn failure.

    Args:
        workspace_root: The per-deployment workspace root (``app.state``). When
            ``None`` (CLI / test path) the file tools have no scoped provider
            anyway, so staging is a no-op.
        owner_id: Authenticated tenant id — the first scope segment.
        persona_id: Persona owning the conversation — the second scope segment.
        documents: The :class:`SandboxFile` carriers already resolved for this
            turn by :func:`_resolve_turn_documents` (path ``uploads/<filename>``,
            bytes in ``content_bytes``).
