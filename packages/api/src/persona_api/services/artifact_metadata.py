"""Workspace artifact metadata sidecar — Spec F5 T03 (D-F5-2).

Sidecar JSON files live next to workspace bytes at ``<bytes-path>.f5.json``.
Producer code (F3 upload service, Spec 15 imagegen, Spec 16/17 sandbox persister)
writes a sidecar at the same write-time as the bytes; the F5 artifact-list
endpoint (T02) reads sidecars to filter/sort/display.

**Suffix choice — Phase 5 discovery (2026-06-07):** Spec 14's
``document_service.upload`` already writes ``<bytes-path>.meta.json``
sidecars containing the :class:`DocumentRef` shape (workspace_path /
format / strategy / token_count / page_count / images). F5's sidecar
shape is semantically different (source / type / producing_spec /
conversation_id / created_at / original_name) so the two sidecars must
co-exist on disk without collision. F5 uses the dedicated ``.f5.json``
suffix; the artifact-list endpoint enumerates non-sidecar files and
skips both ``.meta.json`` AND ``.f5.json`` during the walk. Documented
as a refinement of D-F5-X-artifact-metadata-convention; the decisions
mirror records the amendment.

Why a sidecar over a DB-backed table at v0.1 — D-F5-2: the cheapest cross-spec
amendment surface (~30 LOC per producer family vs ~500+ LOC for a DB-backed
migration + model + RLS policy). Path-prefix is rigid; DB-backed is v0.2
candidate when query complexity demands SQL JOIN.

The sidecar is purely an API-layer concern (not a memory protocol), so this
module lives in ``persona-api/services`` rather than ``persona-core``.
