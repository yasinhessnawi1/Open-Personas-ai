"""API-action audit log (spec 08, T12, §8.2).

A row in ``audit_log`` for every state-changing operation (create/update/delete
persona, create conversation, start/cancel run): ``user_id``, ``action``,
``target``, and a metadata blob. This is API-action forensics — DISTINCT from the
store's per-mutation ``AuditEvent`` (spec 07 handoff: don't conflate them).

``audit_log`` is NOT under RLS (spec-07 rls.py) — it's append-only platform
forensics read by admins, and ``persona_app`` has INSERT-only on it. The write
records ``user_id`` explicitly (not via the RLS GUC).
