Read-only platform-global lists of the available tools and bundled skills, for
the web app's authoring-flow checkboxes. Not RLS-scoped (no tenant data).

Tools: sourced from the persona-core known-tool catalog (spec 26 T08,
``persona.tools.TOOL_CATALOG``) — the single source of truth for every built-in
platform tool, including runtime-wired ones (``code_execution`` /
``generate_image`` / ``text_summarize``) whose factories need runtime context.
The runtime fails loud (D-12-5, D-15-X) if a persona declares a runtime-wired
tool that is not configured on the deployment.

Skills: the bundled v0.1 skill set scanned from ``persona/skills/builtin``

    Spec 30 T11 + N1 (D-N1-3/4). The bundled ``catalog.toml`` is the authoritative
    **floor** — it is also the fail-soft fallback target — so its authored entries
    (curated security notes, gap-detection keywords, verb-phrase capabilities)
    **supersede a same-named mirror entry**; the ~220–300 Docker-registry mirror fills
    the long tail. Merge policy is therefore a name-keyed union with **builtin-wins on
    collision**, in a deterministic order: builtins (``catalog.toml`` order) first,
    then mirror entries (mirror order) whose names are not already a builtin.

    When no mirror snapshot exists, :func:`load_mirror_catalog` returns the builtin
    catalog (its fallback), so the result is exactly the builtins — a turn with no
    mirror still resolves every built-in server. A persona enables a server by adding
    ``mcp:<name>`` to its ``tools`` allow-list; bring-your-own servers are NOT here

    (``PERSONA_MCP_MIRROR_PATH`` — the writable mirror on the mounted volume) when configured,
    falling through to the bundled snapshot then the builtin floor. ``mirror_path`` defaults to
    the env-derived override; tests pass it explicitly. A server the auto-sync *removed* is no
