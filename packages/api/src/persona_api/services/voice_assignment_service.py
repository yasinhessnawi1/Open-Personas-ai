"""Build-time voice auto-assignment (Issue 1, fail-soft).

At persona create the global TTS default is a single English voice, so a female
persona spoke with a male voice (and vice-versa). This service gives a freshly
created persona a *fitting* catalogue voice: a small-tier model reads the
persona's identity and the language-filtered voice catalogue and picks the voice
whose gender and character best match — the audible analogue of the avatar
auto-generation hook next to it in the create flow.

Everything fail-softs. A persona that cannot be voiced (TTS unconfigured, the
catalogue fetch fails, the model returns nothing usable, the builder already
chose a voice) keeps the global default — exactly the pre-Issue-1 behaviour, so
create never fails on a voice-pick problem.

The voice catalogue lives in the separate ``persona-voice`` service; this module
reaches it over its public ``GET /v1/voices`` endpoint, forwarding the caller's
bearer token (the same any-signed-in-user auth the web voice-selector uses), so
no service credential is introduced.
