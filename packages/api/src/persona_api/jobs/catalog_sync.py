"""The MCP catalog auto-sync task — a leader-gated worker-loop periodic (Spec N2, T3).

N2 keeps N1's Docker catalog mirror fresh automatically. A catalog sync is a **system-level
(ownerless)** recurring job, so it does NOT use A1's owner-scoped schedules; instead it is the
identical ownerless-periodic shape as the worker loop's existing ``_maybe_run_maintenance`` /
``_maybe_run_scheduler_tick`` siblings — a third periodic task the worker drives on its own
cadence (N2-D-1).

:class:`CatalogSyncTask` is the unit of one sync:

1. **Leader-gate** (N2-D-2) — acquire a Postgres advisory lock with the catalog-sync key
   (independent of the scheduler-tick leader) so exactly one process pulls. Single-machine today
   makes this moot, but it expresses "one puller" for the network clone and keeps the sync
   coherent with N2-D-1's documented multi-replica escape hatch. The lock is acquired AND released
   **within one** :meth:`run_once` (transient, not held across runs) via a fresh
   :class:`~persona_api.schedules.leadership.SchedulerLeader` — so the whole call is safe to run on
   any thread-pool thread (the held DBAPI connection never crosses calls/threads).
2. **Reconcile** (criteria 1/2/5) — :func:`~persona.tools.mcp.mirror_reconcile.reconcile_mirror`
   re-pulls + diffs + atomically writes the snapshot at the resolved writable path
   (:func:`~persona.tools.mcp.mirror.resolve_mirror_write_path`).
3. **Observe** (criterion 5, N2-D-6) — log ran-at + added/updated/removed counts (structured-log
   posture; an ownerless event doesn't fit the owner-scoped ``audit_log``).

**Fail-soft (N2-D-3):** a clone/parse failure raises inside ``reconcile_mirror`` BEFORE the write,
so the last-good mirror is preserved (D-N1-4); :meth:`run_once` catches it, logs, and returns
``None`` — the worker retries on the next cadence. A non-leader call is a clean no-op (returns
``None``, touches no files).

**Blocking-aware:** the reconcile does a blocking ``git clone`` + file I/O. The in-process worker
shares the API event loop, so the worker loop offloads :meth:`run_once` to a thread
(``asyncio.to_thread``) — never inline — so a multi-second clone never stalls request/SSE handling.
