"""The worker service — the fourth process class (Spec A0, T4).

A long-lived process that claims durable jobs and runs them through the same
runtime the api uses (one runtime, two execution paths). This module owns the
worker's **composition root** — the worker's analogue of ``app.py``'s lifespan —
wiring the two engines that enforce the RLS boundary:

- **dispatch engine** (cross-tenant): claim/heartbeat/complete on the jobs tables
  only. v0.1 defaults to the superuser ``database_url``; point
  ``WORKER_DISPATCH_DATABASE_URL`` at a least-privilege ``job_dispatcher`` role
  to harden (pure config — D-A0-X-rls-chokepoint).
- **RLS engine** (``persona_app``, owner-scoped): the only engine handlers touch,
  via the per-job :class:`WorkerJobContext`.

The two are kept structurally apart: the dispatch engine reaches the queue, never
a handler; the RLS engine reaches handlers, never the cross-tenant claim. The
continuous poll loop + graceful drain (signals, drain bound) land in T5; T4
provides :meth:`Worker.run_once` (claim a batch, execute each) and the health
probes.
