"""Per-request sandbox context (spec 12 T10).

Threads the request's ``(owner_id, conversation_id)`` from
:func:`chat_service.stream_chat` into the runtime factory's toolbox-build step
WITHOUT changing every loop-builder signature in the codebase. ``contextvars``
is the right shape: async-safe per-request state that propagates through
``await`` boundaries.

**Why contextvars rather than a parameter:** the existing
``app.state.build_conversation_loop`` closure has signature
``(persona_id) -> Loop`` and is replaced by ~10 integration-test fixtures
with scripted loops. Widening the closure signature ripples through every
test; threading via contextvars keeps the boundary unchanged and the test
overrides untouched (their loops don't read the context).

The tool factory wraps the contextvar lookup in
:class:`SandboxRequestContext` so the session_id derivation
(``f"{owner_id}:{conversation_id}"`` per kickoff trip-up #6) is enforced in
one place — never reconstructed ad-hoc downstream.

    Frozen + slots — the receipt is immutable; any state change is a new

    **T12 F-T12-INT-01 hardening (MEDIUM, STRUCTURAL-CLEAR):** the
    workflow audit found that an unescaped ``:`` separator in either field
    produces cross-tenant session_id collisions
    (e.g. ``("alice", "bob:c1")`` and ``("alice:bob", "c1")`` both derive
    to ``"alice:bob:c1"``; the pool's idempotent-on-session_id acquire would
    silently share the substrate IPython kernel between distinct tenants).
    Current Clerk owner_ids (``user_{alnum}``) and server-generated
    conversation_ids (``conv_{uuid.hex}``) never contain ``:``, so the v0.1
    attack path is gated by ingress invariants; this validator is a
    defense-in-depth fail-fast at the boundary so a future ingress change
    can't silently introduce cross-tenant data access.
