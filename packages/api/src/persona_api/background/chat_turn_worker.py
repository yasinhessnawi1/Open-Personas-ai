"""Detached chat-turn worker + in-process event bus (spec P1, T1+T2b, D-P1-detached-execution).

A chat turn executes as a detached ``asyncio.Task`` so a client disconnect
(navigate / reload / tab close) **no longer cancels it** — the persona keeps
working until it decides to stop. Mirrors ``RunRegistry`` (``run_worker.py``)
1:1; the chat-shaped differences:

- the live queue carries ``("event", RunEvent)`` / ``("chunk", StreamChunk)`` /
  ``("done", payload)`` / ``("error", payload)`` items + a ``None`` sentinel, so
  the SSE tail interleaves tool events and text deltas in true emission order and
  ends with the same ``done`` payload shape the old inline ``stream_chat`` sent;
- the ``tier`` event is **captured into the ``done`` payload** (not a frame),
  matching the inline contract (the router's real choice rides ``done``);
- there is **no** ``responses`` queue (no ask-user) and **no** ``CancelToken``
  (``ConversationLoop.turn`` exposes none — an explicit cancel is a task-level
  ``cancel()``, D-P1-cancel);
- the registry is keyed by **``conversation_id``** (one-active-turn — D-P1-one-active-turn).

Persistence is the injected :class:`ChatTurnSink` (``messages``-backed —
``MessagesTurnSink``). Checkpoints are **throttled** (D-P1-cadence): a tool event
flushes immediately; text deltas debounce by char-count / wall-time (never
per-token). On CLEAN completion the worker finalizes, **deducts credits** (the
D-08-6 revision — bill regardless of client presence, D-P1-billing-contract),
runs the best-effort ``on_complete`` hook (auto-title), and emits ``done``;
cancel/error finalize the partial WITHOUT billing. In-process + single-worker
(D-08-5); a restart loses the task — the checkpointed partial remains, reconciled
to ``interrupted`` by the startup sweep (D-P1-restart-sweep).
