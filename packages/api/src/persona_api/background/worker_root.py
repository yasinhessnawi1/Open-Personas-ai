"""The in-process worker root — activates the synthesis pipeline (Spec K2, T8d).

The deploy is a single uvicorn process (D-08-5), so A0's durable worker + A1's
scheduler tick run as an **in-process background task** started in the API
lifespan, not a separate machine. This module is that composition root + the
task manager:

- :func:`build_worker_registry` composes the typed :class:`JobRegistry` — the
  ``synthesis`` handler (the K2 reflection pass) wired to the
  :class:`PgSynthesisRepository` + a :class:`Synthesizer` built on the wired
  small/mid tier (``build_synthesizer``), graph store, and a
  :class:`PostgresEntityRegistry`.
- :class:`InProcessWorker` owns the ``Worker.run()`` task: it starts the
  claim→execute loop (with A1's leader-gated scheduler tick wired additively) on
  app startup and drains it on shutdown.

The synthesis ``Synthesizer`` is built ONCE on the RLS engine. The worker's
per-job choke point sets the ``current_user_id`` contextvar to the job owner, and
the RLS engine's checkout listener scopes every connection to it — so the single
shared graph store + entity registry are owner-scoped per job automatically (no
per-job rebuild). The synthesis tier (``config.synthesis_tier``, default
``small``) is the eval-re-run gate's tier, NOT the frontier/sonnet tier.
