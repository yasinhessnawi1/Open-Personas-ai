"""Image-generation composition (spec 15 T15).

This module is the hosted-service composition root for image generation.
It glues together the four cost-discipline + safety primitives the
preceding tasks delivered:

* **Concurrency cap** (T14 :func:`persona_api.imagegen.concurrency.acquire_user_concurrency`)
  — Postgres advisory transactional lock keyed by ``hash(user_id)``;
  multi-worker-correct from day one (D-15-X-concurrency-cap).
* **Pre-deduct credits** (T13 :func:`persona_api.services.credits_service.deduct`)
  — credits acquired BEFORE the provider call so a parallel-fire
  denial-of-wallet attacker cannot burn N generations before the first
  deduction lands (D-15-X-pre-deduct-credits).
* **Backend dispatch** (T06 / T07 :class:`persona.imagegen.protocol.ImageBackend`)
  — provider-agnostic generation call. SDK exceptions are caught and
  re-raised as :mod:`persona.imagegen.errors` domain types at the adapter
  boundary; the service layer maps them through the refund-on-failure
  funnel.
* **Workspace persistence** (D-13-4 layout via
  :func:`persona.tools._sandbox.resolve_sandbox_path`) — bytes land at
  ``{workspace_root}/{owner_id}/{persona_id}/uploads/{blake2b}.{ext}``,
  the same layout :func:`persona_api.services.image_service.upload`
  produces so the existing ``GET /v1/personas/:id/uploads/:ref`` route
  serves generated images provenance-blindly (D-15-X-workspace-coordination).
* **Refund-on-failure** (T13 :func:`persona_api.services.credits_service.refund`)
  — reverse-deduct ledger entry on backend or post-gen moderation failure;
  pattern (a) per D-15-X-credit-flow-semantics (no Alembic migration
  required; ``credit_transactions.delta`` is ``Integer, nullable=False``
  with no ``CheckConstraint`` so positive deltas are physically allowed).

**Transactional shape.** The cap acquisition and the pre-deduct land in a
single ``rls_engine.begin()`` transaction so the cap is HELD while the
deduction is observed by Postgres; the backend ``await`` happens *inside*
that same context manager so the lock persists across the provider call
(the lock auto-releases on commit/rollback at the surrounding ``with``
exit). When the backend raises, we exit the original transaction (which
rolls back — releasing the lock) and then open a *separate*
``credits_service.refund`` transaction to issue the reverse-deduct
ledger entry. The two-transaction shape is intentional: the refund must
NOT share a transaction with the cap lock because rolling back the
original transaction is what releases the lock — collapsing the refund
into that transaction would either keep the lock during the refund
(wrong) or commit the deduct prematurely (wrong).

**Why credits_service.deduct/refund instead of inline SQL?** T13 owns
the ledger semantics; this module composes. Going through
:mod:`persona_api.services.credits_service` ensures the two ledger
writes (deduct + refund) are byte-for-byte symmetric with the rest of
the credits machinery — a future audit query summing ``delta`` by user
keeps reconstructing the running balance correctly.

    """Run one full image-generation flow: cap → deduct → backend → persist.

    On the happy path the returned :class:`GenerationResult` carries
    persisted images: each :attr:`persona.imagegen.result.GeneratedImage.workspace_path`
    is populated with the workspace-relative path
    (``uploads/<blake2b><ext>``) and :attr:`image_bytes` is zeroed so the
    response envelope does not double-carry the payload. The credits
    ledger shows one ``-count*cost_per_image_credits`` entry; the audit
    log will carry the persona-layer
    :class:`persona.tools.audit.ToolAuditEvent` emitted by the
    ``generate_image`` tool factory (T12 owns that emission — the
    service layer composes the cap + deduct + persistence around the
    backend call but the audit is the tool's; the route layer's
    ``audit_service.record`` adds the HTTP-layer event).

    On a backend failure (:class:`ContentRejectedError` from provider
    moderation or :class:`ImageGenError` family for auth / rate / etc.)
    the credits are refunded via :func:`credits_service.refund` in a
    fresh transaction (the original transaction rolled back, releasing
    the cap lock) and the original exception is re-raised so the route
    layer can map it to the appropriate HTTP status.

    On a concurrency-capped path
    (:class:`ConcurrencyCappedError`) NO credits are deducted — the
    cap fires before the deduct in the same transaction so the rollback
    leaves the balance untouched.

    Args:
        rls_engine: The per-request RLS-scoped SQLAlchemy
            :class:`~sqlalchemy.Engine`. Both the cap+deduct transaction
            and the refund-on-failure transaction open through this
            engine so the per-request user_id RLS scope is preserved.
        workspace_root: Per-deployment workspace root (typically
            ``settings.persona_workspace_root``). Generated bytes land
            at ``workspace_root / user_id / persona_id / uploads / <blake2b><ext>``.
        backend: A concrete
            :class:`persona.imagegen.protocol.ImageBackend` implementation
            (OpenAI gpt-image-1 via
            :class:`persona.imagegen.openai_image.OpenAIImageBackend` or
            Flux 1.1 [pro] via
            :class:`persona.imagegen.fal_image.FalImageBackend` for v0.1;
            composition root selects via
            :func:`persona.imagegen.load_image_backend`).
        user_id: Authenticated tenant identifier — feeds the advisory-
            lock key (hashed via md5 in the concurrency helper) AND the
            workspace path's ``owner_id`` segment AND the credits ledger
            ``user_id`` column.
        persona_id: Persona owning this generation. Workspace path
            segment + audit payload.
        persona_visual_style: The persona's
            :attr:`persona.schema.persona.PersonaIdentity.visual_style`
            (T10). Merged into the prompt via :func:`merge_visual_style`
            per D-15-4; ``None`` / empty / whitespace-only yields the
            identity branch (no merge).
        prompt: The user / runtime prompt as supplied. The visual-style
            merge runs at the service layer (here) so the backend sees
            the merged prompt; this is structurally important because a
            misconfigured tool wrapper would otherwise let the model
            bypass the merge by calling the backend directly.
        options: Closed-preset image-generation knobs
            (:class:`persona.imagegen.result.ImageGenOptions`). The
            ``count <= 4`` cap (D-15-3) is already enforced by the
            Pydantic field; this service trusts that.
        cost_per_image_credits: Credits per image. Defaults to
            :data:`DEFAULT_COST_PER_IMAGE_CREDITS` (100). Override is
            available for future per-quality pricing if D-15-3 gains
            tiers — v0.1 ships flat.

    Returns:
        :class:`GenerationResult` with images whose ``workspace_path``
        is populated and ``image_bytes`` is zeroed.

    Raises:
        ConcurrencyCappedError: The per-user cap is already held by a
            concurrent in-flight generation for this ``user_id`` — the
            route layer surfaces 429 + ``Retry-After``. No credits are
            touched.
        ContentRejectedError: Provider moderation refused the prompt
            (input stage) or flagged the generated bytes (output stage,
            D-15-X-flagged-image-policy). Credits are refunded before
            the exception propagates.
        ImageGenError: Other backend failure (auth, rate limit,
            transient, timeout, unsupported option). Credits are refunded
            before the exception propagates.

    The build-time sibling of :func:`generate`. It composes the SAME backend
    + persistence + hard-line filter primitives but is **free** — no
    ``credits_service.deduct``/``refund`` and **no** per-user concurrency
    advisory lock (D-29-2): auto-avatar-gen is system-initiated at create,
    not a user-requested generation, so neither the user's ledger nor their
    image-gen concurrency state moves. Each call emits exactly one JSONL
    :class:`~persona.tools.audit.ToolAuditEvent` (no migration) tagged
    ``system_initiated=true`` / ``credits_charged=0`` so an operator can
    count auto-gen outcomes without touching the ledger.

    Unlike :func:`generate`, the prompt is **already crafted** by
    :func:`persona.imagegen.craft_avatar_prompt` (which has merged
    ``visual_style`` per D-29-1) — so this entry does NOT re-merge a visual
    style. It DOES run the hard-line categorical filter explicitly: the
    operator/service path does not otherwise run it (only the runtime tool
    factory does), so this is the D-29-1 defense-in-depth backstop that
    catches an adversarial *declared* ``visual_style`` reflected verbatim
    into the prompt (the crafter is clean by construction; the filter is the
    backstop for whatever a user declares).

    The function **raises** the imagegen domain exceptions on failure
    (``ContentRejectedError`` for the hard-line trigger or provider
    moderation; ``ImageGenError`` family for auth/rate/transient/timeout) —
    the build-time hook (Spec 29 T3) catches the full surface and fail-softs
    to ``avatar_url=null`` so persona-create never fails (D-29-X-fail-soft).
    The ``backend is None`` and wall-clock-timeout cases are the hook's to
    handle (the hook guards ``app.state.image_backend`` and wraps this call
    in ``asyncio.wait_for``); this entry requires a live backend.

    Args:
        workspace_root: Per-deployment workspace root. Bytes land at
            ``workspace_root / user_id / persona_id / uploads / <blake2b><ext>``,
            served by the existing uploads route (provenance-blind).
        backend: A live :class:`~persona.imagegen.protocol.ImageBackend`.
        user_id: Authenticated owner — workspace path segment + audit.
        persona_id: The persona being built — workspace path + audit.
        prompt: The already-crafted avatar prompt (incl. the ``visual_style``
            merge). Passed to the backend verbatim; NOT re-merged.
        audit_logger: Optional JSONL tool-audit sink. When provided, one
            ``ToolAuditEvent`` is emitted per call recording the outcome.

    Returns:
        A :class:`GenerationResult` whose single image has
