"""Open-core edition seams (Spec 33).

The commercial concerns — request ownership (auth), credits metering — sit
behind interfaces with a community default impl and the existing cloud impl,
selected once by ``PERSONA_EDITION`` at the app factory (D-33-1). The
persistence seam (SQLite vs Postgres) lives in ``persona_api.db``; the safety
guard lives in :mod:`persona_api.editions.guard`.
