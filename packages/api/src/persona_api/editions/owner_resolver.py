"""The auth seam: "who owns this request?" → ``owner_id`` (Spec 33, §2.1).

``OwnerResolver`` is the single seam through which the edition decides request
ownership. Everything downstream — the RLS contextvar, the persona-ownership
pre-flight on every route — consumes ``owner_id`` **unchanged** (D-33-X-
ownerresolver-seam): only the *source* of the owner swaps.

- :class:`CloudOwnerResolver` reproduces today's behavior exactly — verify the
  Clerk JWT (via the overridable ``verify`` seam), JIT-provision the ``users``
  row on the superuser engine. No behavior change for cloud.
- :class:`CommunityOwnerResolver` returns a fixed local owner (D-33-3): no JWT,
  no sign-in, single-user. The owner row is pre-seeded at startup
  (D-33-X-owner-seed), so no JIT provisioning is needed.
"""

# (it returns a fixed owner) but must keep the OwnerResolver Protocol signature.
