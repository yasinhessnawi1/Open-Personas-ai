"""Structural RLS connection scoping (spec 08, T05, D-08-1).

THE load-bearing security invariant of the whole spec, settled by the Phase-3
spike (research §1). Restated for any future reader (a launch audit, a new
contributor):

> RLS-scoping is a **property of the per-request engine's connection pool**, not
> a call any route makes — so it cannot be forgotten. A ``checkout`` pool
> listener runs ``set_config('app.current_user_id', <uid or ''>, false)`` on
> **every** connection the engine hands out, reading the uid from a
> request-scoped :data:`current_user_id` ``ContextVar``. Therefore every
> connection the request touches — the route's own queries AND the runtime
> store's ``engine.begin()``/``connect()`` calls (``PostgresBackend`` opens its
> own transactions, [postgres.py]) — is scoped before any SQL runs. A
> ``checkin`` listener resets the GUC to ``''`` so **no tenant id residue
> survives to the next checkout** (the leak-prevention invariant; proven under
> ``pool_size=1`` reuse in research §1, Q2). An absent/empty uid yields
> ``current_setting(...) IS NULL`` → matches no RLS policy row → **fail-closed**
> (zero rows, never a leak; reproduced as the spike's negative control).

The single moving part is the :data:`current_user_id` ``ContextVar``: it is set
in exactly one place — the auth dependency (:mod:`persona_api.auth.deps`) at the
start of each request — and reset at request end. Its per-request / per-task
isolation (no bleed across concurrent ``asyncio`` tasks) is regression-tested
(research §5 confirmed it under ``asyncio.gather``).

``PostgresBackend`` is **left untouched** (mechanism (a), not "inject a
connection" (b)) — no spec-07 surgery, no risk to the shipped store tests.

``set_config(..., false)`` (session-scoped, not ``true``/transaction-local) is
used here because the value is set at *checkout*, before SQLAlchemy begins the
transaction; the checkin reset is what bounds its lifetime to the request. This
was verified in the spike (Q1: the value survives into the request's
transaction; Q2: it never leaks to the next checkout).
