"""The scheduler tick — leader-gated due-claim + cross-tenant materialisation (Spec A1, T6).

The tick is A1's clock hand. When (and only when) this worker holds leadership
(D-A1-5), one tick:

1. **Claims due schedules cross-tenant** — a global poll on the DISPATCH engine
   (``next_fire_at <= now``, served by the partial ``idx_schedules_due`` index),
   so it sees every owner's due rows. This is the dispatch side of the
   dispatch-vs-RLS split (the worker's dispatch engine sees all tenants).
2. **Materialises each due fire FOR THAT SCHEDULE'S OWNER** — for each due
   schedule it switches to the owner's scope and (a) enqueues an A0 job via
   ``JobQueue`` (owner-scoped RLS engine + owner GUC) keyed by the deterministic
   ``schedule_id+fire_time`` idempotency key, then (b) advances the schedule's
   bookkeeping (owner-scoped ``ScheduleStore.apply_fire``). Both are owner-scoped
   — the RLS side of the split.

**Effectively-once (criterion 4).** The idempotency key makes a double tick, a
leader handover mid-tick, or a crash-rerun all dedup to exactly one A0 job per
``(schedule, fire_time)`` — A1 rides A0's ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``, it does not
reinvent effectively-once. Enqueue happens BEFORE the bookkeeping advance, so a
crash between the two re-enqueues (a no-op) on the next tick rather than skipping.

**No burst (the structural invariant).** The advance is
``next_fire_after(now)`` — a backlog of missed occurrences collapses to a single
fire that jumps to the next FUTURE occurrence, never a one-per-tick replay. The
fired scheduled instant (``fire_time``) is what the job carries (criterion 8), so
a late fire still says "this is the 7am briefing for that morning." The
fire-late-once-vs-skip-and-note POLICY + grace window + durable miss note (the
nuance on top of this structural floor) land in T7.

**The handoff contract (criterion 8).** Every fired job's payload carries
``schedule_id`` + ``fire_time`` (``persona.schedules.fire_payload``), so a
downstream A2 leg can anchor on which schedule + which scheduled instant it is.
