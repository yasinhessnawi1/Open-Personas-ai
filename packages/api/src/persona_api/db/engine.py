"""Engine factory and the RLS session helper (spec 07, T06, D-07-5).

The hosted service connects with a non-superuser role under RLS. Every
request-scoped DB access must run inside a transaction where the current
user id has been set on the ``app.current_user_id`` session GUC, which the
per-table policies (``rls.py``) read.

The user id is set with ``set_config('app.current_user_id', :uid, true)`` —
NOT ``SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = :uid``, which is a syntax error with a
bound parameter (``SET`` is a utility statement that rejects placeholders;
research §6). ``set_config(..., is_local => true)`` is a normal, parameterised,
injection-safe function call that is transaction-local (auto-clears on
commit/rollback) — exactly the RLS contract.

Spec 08's request middleware composes :func:`rls_connection`: open it with the
authenticated user id for the duration of the request, hand the connection to
the route/store, commit on success or roll back on error.
