"""K2 operator pass — the model-callable ``record_user_fact`` tool, LIVE (Spec K2, §5.3).

Runtime-level live pass (real Postgres + the real ``PostgresGraphStore`` + a
deterministic embedder) for the direct-write tool, which is NOT operator-exempt (it
is a model-callable surface). Synthesis is already covered by the green wired-tier
eval + the wired-pipeline integration proof; this leg adds the direct path:

  1. a persona records an explicit fact mid-conversation → it LANDS in the graph,
     owner-scoped (RLS holds), ``source=persona_self``;
  2. another persona of the SAME owner RETRIEVES it (the shared-brain loop);
  3. a self-harm-means fact is REJECTED before the write (the means backstop, D-K2-7).

Run with ``-s`` and capture stdout into
``docs/specs/phase3/spec_K2/evidence/operator_pass_<date>.log``.
