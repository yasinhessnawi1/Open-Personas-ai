"""Parallel-fire pre-deduct regression test (spec 15 T17).

The binary structural proof of D-15-X-pre-deduct-credits +
D-15-X-concurrency-cap *together*: fires 10 concurrent
``POST /v1/personas/:id/imagegen`` requests from one user against a
mocked backend that holds the request open for ~500ms then returns a
single image, and asserts that exactly ONE deduct lands in the credits
ledger, exactly NINE 429s are returned, exactly ONE 201 is returned,
exactly ONE ``imagegen.create`` audit row is recorded, and exactly ONE
image file ends up on disk for this user.

Why this is the binary proof of the two decisions combined:

* **Without pre-deduct** (D-15-X-pre-deduct-credits removed → deduct
  AFTER the backend returns), 10 concurrent in-flight calls could fire
  10 backend calls before any deduction lands → ``final_balance ==
  start_balance - 10 × per_image_cost`` (or, with refund-on-failure,
  zero — but no protection against the denial-of-wallet amplifier).
* **Without the concurrency cap** (D-15-X-concurrency-cap removed),
  all 10 deductions would land in parallel (each in its own
  transaction) and 10 backend calls would fire → again ``-10 × cost``.
* **Without both** (the world before spec 15 imagined this cost
  discipline existed), nothing structurally prevents the amplifier.

With BOTH locks combined the structural property is binary:

* The per-user advisory lock allows exactly ONE request to hold the
  slot at a time. The other nine see ``acquired=False`` and raise
  :class:`persona_api.errors.ConcurrencyCappedError` → 429 BEFORE the
  pre-deduct fires (the cap raise happens inside the same
  ``rls_engine.begin()`` block that owns the deduct, BEFORE the
  ``credits_service.deduct`` call).
* The one request that holds the slot pre-deducts EXACTLY ONCE, calls
  the backend (which holds for ~500ms — long enough that the other
  nine threads have all observed the lock as held), receives bytes,
  persists them to the workspace, audits, and returns 201.

The test fires requests from 10 OS threads via a
:class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, synchronised by a
:class:`threading.Barrier` so all 10 enter the route layer
near-simultaneously. The test uses the real Docker Postgres
(``migrated_engine`` fixture) so the advisory-lock primitive is
exercised against the real Postgres feature it relies on; mocking the
lock would invalidate the very property under test.
