"""Migration + RLS + constraint tests for the ``calls`` table (Spec V9, V9-D-5).

Runs against a real Postgres built by ``alembic upgrade head`` (so migration
``021_add_calls_table`` + its RLS policy are present). Concerns:

1. **Table + valid insert** — a call-record inserts cleanly with its FK parents
   (user → persona → conversation), ``ended_at``/``duration_s``/``end_reason``
   nullable while live.
2. **end_reason CHECK** — rejects an out-of-vocabulary reason.
3. **ON DELETE CASCADE** — deleting the conversation removes its call-records
   (v1 retention falls out of the FK, V9-D-5).
4. **RLS tenant isolation** (adversarial, the standing gate) — seed two tenants
   as superuser, then under each user's RLS context as the NON-SUPERUSER
   ``persona_app`` role assert zero cross-tenant rows + WITH CHECK blocks a
   cross-tenant insert. The non-superuser role is mandatory: superusers bypass
   RLS even under FORCE. ``APP_DATABASE_URL`` provides the role DSN; RLS tests
   skip if it is unset.
