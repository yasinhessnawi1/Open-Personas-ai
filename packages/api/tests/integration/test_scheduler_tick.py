"""Integration tests for the scheduler tick + materialisation (Spec A1, T6).

Real Postgres: the tick claims due schedules cross-tenant (dispatch engine) and
materialises each into an A0 job owner-scoped (RLS engine). Proves:

* **leader-gated** — a non-leader tick is a no-op (claims/materialises nothing);
* **materialisation + handoff (criterion 8)** — a due schedule produces exactly
  one A0 job of the schedule's target type, owned by the schedule's owner, whose
  payload carries the ``schedule_id`` + ``fire_time`` anchor a downstream leg reads;
* **bookkeeping** — fire_count bumps, next_fire advances to a FUTURE instant;
* **effectively-once (criterion 4)** — a crash-rerun of the same due fire yields
  exactly one job per ``(schedule, fire_time)`` (the idempotency key);
* **no burst (structural)** — a long-missed schedule fires ONCE and jumps to the
  next future occurrence, never one-per-tick replay (the grace/skip POLICY + the
  downtime-simulation suite are T7).
