"""OpenAPI sanity (spec 08, T14, acceptance #12).

The web app (spec 09) generates its TypeScript client from FastAPI's OpenAPI
spec. We can't run the TS codegen here, so the proof is a well-formed
``/openapi.json`` with the approved ``channel``/``format_hints`` additions
serialising with correct optionality/nullability, and the endpoint surface
present.
