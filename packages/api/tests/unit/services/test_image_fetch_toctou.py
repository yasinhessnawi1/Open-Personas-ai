"""Service-level TOCTOU test for the image download path (Spec R2, T3 / F-03).

``image_service.fetch`` is the most-exposed serve site (user-facing download,
user-controlled ``ref``). This proves the end-to-end hardening: a regular image
that is swapped for a symlink pointing OUTSIDE the sandbox after resolution is
served as ``not_found`` (via the ``is_regular_file_nofollow`` lstat guard +
``read_nofollow_bytes``), never leaking the out-of-sandbox bytes.
