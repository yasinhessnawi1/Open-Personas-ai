"""Community-edition zero-infra boot (Spec 33, Cluster B keystone, half 2).

Proves the "clone → set a model key → run" promise without Postgres/Docker:
``create_app`` under ``PERSONA_EDITION=community`` boots on SQLite + Chroma, seeds
the single local owner, serves requests with NO auth wall, and the relational
store works through a real route — all in a temp dir, no external services.

    Regression guard. ``persona_service`` used to hardcode ``PostgresBackend`` when
    composing the four typed stores for create/update, so on the community edition
    (SQLite relational store + Chroma vectors) the create-time memory population
    failed with ``no such table: memory_chunks`` — that table only exists on the
    Postgres relational store; community keeps typed-memory vectors in Chroma. The
    fix threads the app's edition-appropriate ``memory_backend`` (the one the
    lifespan wired at boot) into the store composition.

    This exercises the service layer directly with the engine + Chroma backend the
    app booted — the exact ``no such table: memory_chunks`` failure point — without
    coupling the guard to the persona-detail capability hydration (a separate
    rough edge that needs a model key, irrelevant to the storage bug). Pre-fix the
    ``registry.load_persona`` call below raises ``OperationalError`` against SQLite;
    post-fix the chunks land in Chroma and are queryable.
