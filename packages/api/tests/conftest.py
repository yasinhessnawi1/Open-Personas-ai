"""Shared test fixtures for persona-api.

The api test tree has NO ``__init__.py`` (spec-05 finding #1 — avoids a

    - the :func:`pg_engine` fixture rebuilds TABLES ONLY (no ``alembic_version``,
      no RLS policies, no ``persona_app`` grants).

    A bare table-existence check would treat a ``pg_engine`` rebuild as "at head"

    the ``persona_app`` grants (→ ``InsufficientPrivilege``). So require all of:
    the key table exists, Alembic stamped a revision, the RLS policy is present,
    AND the ``persona_app`` role (when it exists) still holds its schema/table
    grants. Any miss → :func:`migrated_engine` re-migrates before truncating.

    The grant check closes a real bleed: ``test_migration_graph`` ends by running
    a raw ``alembic upgrade head`` on a freshly recreated ``public`` schema (via a
    SEPARATE engine), which rebuilds the tables + RLS but does NOT re-run
    :func:`_migrate_to_head`'s ``GRANT … TO persona_app``. Without the grant probe,
    ``_schema_is_at_head`` returned True (tables + version + policy all present), so
    the self-repair was skipped and the next ``persona_app``-driven RLS test saw
    every table as ``relation … does not exist`` (Postgres masks a missing
    schema-USAGE grant as a missing relation). Re-granting is exactly what
    :func:`_migrate_to_head` does, so failing the head check here triggers it.

    Every probe runs in a SINGLE connection inside one ``to_regclass`` lookup so
    the table-existence test and the row reads observe ONE catalog snapshot.
    Splitting them (``inspect()`` in one transaction, then a ``SELECT ... FROM
    alembic_version`` in another) was a TOCTOU bug: a concurrent ``DROP SCHEMA``
    via a separate engine — exactly what the migration / ``pg_engine`` tests do —
    could vanish ``alembic_version`` between the two, so the unguarded ``SELECT``
    raised ``UndefinedTable`` instead of the function returning "not at head".
    ``to_regclass`` returns NULL (never raises) for a missing relation, which is
