"""`RunEvent` — the SSE event stream for the run viewer (spec §8).

The :meth:`AgenticLoop.run` ``on_event`` callback receives :class:`RunEvent`
objects that the API (spec 08) serialises to SSE; each event type maps to a
visual element in the run viewer (spec 09). The loop never constructs a
``RunEvent`` by hand — it calls one of the typed classmethod constructors, which
are the single place each event's ``type`` string and ``data`` payload shape are
defined (DRY).

`RunEvent` is frozen Pydantic v2 (D-06-1): it crosses the spec-08 SSE
serialisation boundary. The ``data`` payload is ``dict[str, Any]`` so events can
carry structured detail (tool names, output text); the constructors are
responsible for building **JSON-safe** payloads (tool calls are rendered to
name/args dicts, never raw model objects) so ``model_dump_json`` always succeeds.
