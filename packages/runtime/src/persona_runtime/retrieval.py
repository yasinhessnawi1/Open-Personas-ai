"""Shared per-turn conditioning retrieval (extracted from the text loop, D-V5-6).

The persona-conditioning retrieval — reading identity from its store and
querying self-facts / worldview / episodic for *this* turn — is the single
authoritative representation of "what the persona knows right now." Both the
text :class:`~persona_runtime.loop.ConversationLoop` and the voice turn
(spec V5) MUST share it: reimplementing it would risk conditioning drift
between modalities, which is the persona-bypass the voice spec forbids
(spec V5 §8; criteria 1+2).

This module is the extraction point. :func:`retrieve_context` was previously
``ConversationLoop._retrieve``; the loop now delegates to it byte-identically
(the only behavioural change is *where* the code lives). The added ``identity``
keyword is the spec-V5 D-V5-1 session-cache hook: identity is immutable at
runtime (Spec 01), so a voice session reads it once and passes it back each
turn, skipping the redundant ``get_all`` — while the variable stores are still
queried per turn. The text loop never passes it, so its behaviour is unchanged.

        user_message: This turn's message — the query for the variable stores.

        identity: Pre-fetched identity chunks (the D-V5-1 voice session cache).
            ``None`` (the default, and the text loop's path) reads identity from
