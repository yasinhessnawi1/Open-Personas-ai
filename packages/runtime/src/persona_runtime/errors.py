"""Runtime domain exceptions (D-05-2).

The runtime is a composition layer (hexagonal architecture,
ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md §1.2). It defines exactly **one** new exception —
:class:`TierNotConfiguredError` — for the one genuinely-new failure mode: a
model tier that cannot be resolved even after fallback. Every other failure
(provider 429s, tool-not-allowed, schema mismatches) is a spec-01/02/03 domain
exception that the runtime lets propagate **unchanged**, rather than wrapping it
in a parallel runtime vocabulary the caller would then have to unwrap.

Note on ``MaxToolRoundsExceeded``: there is deliberately **no** such exception.
Hitting ``max_tool_rounds`` is not an error — the loop handles it gracefully
(spec §4.2: append a system nudge, do one final generation). Adding an exception
here would invert that contract; don't.
