"""The ConversationLoop — the integration keystone (T07).

One ``turn(conversation, user_message)`` runs the full per-turn sequence
(spec §4.1): retrieve context → manage history → build prompt → route →
stream-generate with a tool-call sub-loop → episodic write-back → final chunk.
Everything it composes (stores, history manager, backends, toolbox, skills)
already exists and is green; this module is the conductor.

The decisions that shape this file:

- **D-05-X (sync/async summariser bridge):** the history manager is sync and
  pure. The loop predicts whether ``manage()`` will compact this turn (the same
  ``boundary > compacted_up_to`` math), pre-computes the summary by awaiting the
  small tier, then hands ``manage()`` a sync no-op assembler that returns the
  pre-computed string. Never ``asyncio.run()`` inside that callable.
- **D-05-11 (one round counter):** tool re-prompts and ``use_skill`` re-prompts
  share one ``max_tool_rounds`` budget. At the cap, append a system nudge and do
  one final tool-free generation.
- **D-05-12 (episodic write-back):** the write is the LAST step, after the
  generation loop and before the final yield. Because ``turn`` is an async
  generator, a consumer that stops iterating early (or an exception mid-stream)
  never reaches the write — a failed/cancelled turn writes nothing. No
  ``try/finally``.
- **D-05-13 (tool-call reconstruction):** streamed ``ToolCallDelta`` fragments
  are accumulated by ``call_id`` and parsed into ``ToolCall``s at stream end;
  malformed args JSON → empty dict (the ``@tool`` decorator validates).

    fallback-rate trigger consumes ``tier_fallback_count`` /
    ``fallback_engaged`` directly.
