"""The prompt builder (T05; D-05-6, D-05-7, D-05-8).

Assembles the model-ready prompt as a ``list[ConversationMessage]``: one system
message (identity → constraints → self-facts → worldview → episodic → skill
index → active skill content → footer, per spec §5.1), then the compacted +
recent history, then the current user message.

Two budgets, kept distinct:

- The **skill content** budget (2000 tokens) is owned and enforced by
  :class:`persona.skills.SkillInjector` (D-04-7). The builder receives
  already-budgeted ``matched_skill_content`` and splices it verbatim — it does
  NOT define ``SKILL_TOKEN_BUDGET`` and does NOT re-enforce (D-05-7).
- The **whole-prompt** budget is the backend's context window (``max_tokens``).
  When the assembled prompt would exceed it, retrieved context is dropped in
  order — episodic → worldview → self-facts (lowest-relevance first) — and then
  history is truncated more aggressively. Identity, constraints, and the skill
  index are the persona floor and are never dropped (spec §5.3).

Token estimation uses ``persona.skills.count_tokens`` (the shared
``cl100k_base`` encoder, D-05-8) — an *estimate* for budgeting. The exact token
counts in :class:`persona_runtime.logging.TurnLog` come from the backend's
``usage`` field, post-call. Don't conflate the two.
