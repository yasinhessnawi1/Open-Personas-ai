"""Adversarial TOCTOU tests for the shared ``open_nofollow`` opener (Spec R2, T3 / F-03).

``resolve_sandbox_path`` blocks *logical* escape, but there is a narrow window
between the resolver's symlink check and the actual ``open()`` where the final
path component can be swapped for a symlink pointing outside the sandbox root
(a TOCTOU race). ``open_nofollow`` closes that window with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (on
every platform — R2-D-5; ``openat2(RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS)`` is an unbuilt Linux-only
future, R2-R-1, which would additionally cover the intermediate-dir case).

These tests demonstrate the exploit on the *final* component: a plain open would
follow the swapped symlink and read/clobber an out-of-sandbox target; the
``O_NOFOLLOW`` opener rejects it with an ``OSError`` (ELOOP).
