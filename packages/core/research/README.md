# Research

The persona-vector and drift-detection research that informs `persona-core`
lives in a separate project, **Persona-RAG**
(`~/Desktop/Desktop/Persona-RAG`, also on GitHub at
`yasinhessnawi1/Persona-RAG`). This directory holds only the rendered report
from that project.

After running `packages/core/scripts/sync-research.sh`, two files appear here:

- `report.pdf` — the rendered Persona-RAG report (~80 pages).
- `RESEARCH_VERSION` — the source commit SHA, branch, and sync timestamp so
  the vendored report's provenance is recorded in Open-Persona's git
  history.

Nothing else is mirrored. The research code, scripts, figures, persona
YAMLs, and LaTeX sources all live in Persona-RAG and evolve there. If you
want the source, go to that repo.

## Why the report and not the source

The earlier mirror copied the entire Persona-RAG source tree into this
directory and added complexity (sync exclusions, security-review surface
on vendored scripts, duplication of paper sources across two repos). The
report PDF carries the methodology and the findings; that is the only
artefact Open-Persona needs as a forward reference. Decoupling the source
from this repo lets Persona-RAG evolve on its own timeline.

## Refreshing the report

Compile the report in Persona-RAG first
(`cd ~/Desktop/Desktop/Persona-RAG/docs/report && latexmk -pdf main.tex`),
then run the sync from this repo:

```bash
packages/core/scripts/sync-research.sh
```

Override the source path with the `PERSONA_RAG_DIR` environment variable if
your Persona-RAG checkout is elsewhere.

After syncing, commit the result here:

```bash
git add packages/core/research
git commit -m "chore(core): refresh Persona-RAG report"
```

## What persona-core may NOT do

- Do not `import` from this directory. Nothing in `packages/core/src/persona/`
  may depend on a vendored research artefact.
- Do not add this directory to the `uv` workspace, `mypy` targets, `ruff`
  targets, or `pytest` collection paths.
- Do not hand-edit `report.pdf` or `RESEARCH_VERSION`. Both are regenerated
  by the sync script and edits will be lost on the next run.
