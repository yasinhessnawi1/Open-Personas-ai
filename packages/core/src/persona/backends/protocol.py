"""The :class:`ChatBackend` Protocol.

One Protocol; every model backend (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq,
Together, Ollama, local HuggingFace) implements it. Callers depend on
this Protocol — not on any provider SDK or transport.

See ``docs/specs/spec_02/decisions.md`` D-02-5 for the
``chat_stream`` signature rationale (``def -> AsyncIterator[StreamChunk]``,
not ``async def``).
