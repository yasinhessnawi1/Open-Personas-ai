"""The pure, DST-correct next-fire computation (Spec A1, T2) — the architectural lock.

``next_fire_after(schedule, after)`` answers the one question A1 must get exactly
right: *given a schedule and an instant, when is the next fire?* It is pure (no
clock, no DB, no I/O), deterministic, and the home of the DST-edge handling
(D-A1-X-dst-edges-in-localize). The exhaustive DST fixture suite tests THIS file.

**The architecture (proven in research §1.3):** ``dateutil.rrule`` computes the
recurrence as a pure NAIVE wall-clock pattern; the DST edges live HERE, at our
localization step, never in the rule. For each naive-local occurrence we:

    aware = naive.replace(tzinfo=zone, fold=0)        # fold=0 = the FIRST instant
    if not datetime_exists(aware):                    # spring-forward GAP
        aware = resolve_imaginary(aware)              # → the adjusted instant
    fire = aware.astimezone(UTC)

**Gap before fold (the ordering trap, proven):** ``datetime_ambiguous`` returns
``True`` for a *gap* time too, so we never branch on ambiguity — we branch only on
*existence* (the gap), and ``fold=0`` handles the fall-back fold by construction
(the first of the two repeated instants). Checking ambiguity first would mis-route
an imaginary time; this code is immune by never consulting it.

**Bounds.** ``COUNT`` and ``UNTIL`` are enforced HERE against absolute UTC, not fed
to the naive rrule: ``COUNT`` counts fires strictly after the schedule's creation
anchor (so "fire 5 times" = the first 5 future fires, DST-independent); ``UNTIL``
(a stored aware-UTC instant) is compared to each localized UTC fire — apples to
apples in absolute time, so a DST transition can never silently miscount the tail.
