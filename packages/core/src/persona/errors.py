"""Domain exceptions for persona-core.

Every exception raised from persona-core domain logic is a subclass of
:class:`PersonaError`. Provider-specific exceptions (chromadb, httpx, etc.)
are caught at the adapter boundary and re-raised as domain exceptions so
callers depend on our types rather than on a transitive dependency.

Every domain exception accepts a ``context`` dictionary that is included in
``str(self)``. This makes log messages structured without forcing callers to
build a message-template every time — the exception carries the data it needs
to be useful in a log line.

See ``docs/specs/spec_01/decisions.md`` D-01-12 for the structured-context
rationale and ``docs/specs/spec_01/spec_01_core.md`` §11.7.
