"""Docker MCP catalog-mirror loader — request-path, zero-network (Spec N1, D-N1-4).

Loads the bundled ``mirror.json`` snapshot (the offline-synced mirror of
``github.com/docker/mcp-registry``; see :mod:`persona.tools.mcp.mirror_sync`) and
exposes it as an :class:`~persona.tools.mcp.catalog.MCPCatalog`. Resolution is 100%
local — exactly like the builtin ``catalog.toml`` load (D-03-22, the §9.4 precursor)
— so request-time tool resolution never touches the network.

**Fail-soft is the load-bearing property (D-N1-4):** the snapshot is optional and may
be absent (no sync run yet), stale, or corrupt. This loader NEVER raises at boot — a
missing / unreadable / structurally-invalid snapshot falls back to the bundled builtin
catalog (``catalog.toml``). The mirror and the Gateway connection (D-N1-1) are
independent features: you can connect with no mirror, and mirror with no gateway.

This module is deliberately git-/yaml-free (the network-touching sync lives in
:mod:`persona.tools.mcp.mirror_sync`, never reachable from the request path).
