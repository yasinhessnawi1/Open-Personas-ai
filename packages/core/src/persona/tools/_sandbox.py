"""Sandbox path resolver for the file_read / file_write built-ins (T09).

Pure function. No I/O, no ``os.access``, no read/write. The caller (file
tools in T10) opens the resolved path; we only verify the path *would* be
inside the sandbox root after symlink resolution.

Validation order (research.md §5.2 — D-03-13, D-03-14, D-03-15):
1. NULL byte → reject (stdlib raises ``ValueError`` from .resolve() — we
   want our own domain error before the bytes touch ``Path``).
2. Length cap > 4096 chars → reject (stdlib doesn't bound; DOS protection).
3. Backslash on POSIX (``os.sep == "/"``) → reject (defense in depth;
   ``a\\b\\c`` is a single weird filename on POSIX, operator-confusing).
4. Empty / whitespace-only → reject (file tools never want "the directory
   itself"; D-03-13).
5. Absolute path (``os.path.isabs``) → reject.
6. ``Path.resolve(strict=False)`` + ``is_relative_to(root.resolve())`` →
   the inner symlink/traversal check (D-03-14).

Returns the resolved absolute ``Path`` (which may not yet exist —
``file_write`` creates new files). Callers are responsible for opening it.
