"""``file_write`` built-in tool — write a file to the persona's sandbox.

Creates parent directories inside the sandbox as needed. Overwrites
existing files (per spec §6.4). UTF-8 only (D-03-17).

Per Phase 1 refinement #6 + D-03-21 + D-03-25, emits one
:class:`ToolAuditEvent` per write (``action="write"``) when a
``ToolAuditLogger`` is injected at construction. The audit fires AFTER
the write succeeds (failed writes don't pollute the audit log; failures
are logged at WARNING via :mod:`persona.logging` instead).

Path resolution goes through :func:`persona.tools._sandbox.resolve_sandbox_path`.
The final open uses ``O_NOFOLLOW | O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC`` to close
the TOCTOU window between the resolver's symlink check and the actual
write — a symlink swap of the final path component is rejected.

    Args:
        sandbox_root: The sandbox root SOURCE. Either a fixed
            :class:`~pathlib.Path` (CLI / tests — the explicitly chosen,
            unscoped root) OR a zero-arg provider that returns the *current
            request's* per-(owner, persona) root (the hosted path; see
            :func:`persona.tools._sandbox.resolve_request_sandbox_root`). A
            provider is re-evaluated at every dispatch, so a single cached
            toolbox stays correctly scoped across concurrent requests. A
            provider that returns ``None`` (no request scope bound) makes the
            tool fail closed — it writes NOTHING. The tool's path argument
            resolves against the resolved root only.
        audit_logger: Optional tool-audit sink. If provided, every
            successful write emits one :class:`ToolAuditEvent` with
            ``action="write"`` per D-03-21.
        persona_id: Persona identifier for audit records. ``None`` for CLI
            development; audit lines then route to ``_cli.tools.jsonl``.
        persister: Optional :class:`WorkspacePersister` (Spec 28). When
            provided, the written bytes are mirrored to the persona
            workspace and the resolved :class:`PersistedArtifact` lands on
            :attr:`ToolResult.artifacts` so the chat UI renders a file card.
            When ``None`` the result is byte-identical to the pre-Spec-28
            shape (empty ``artifacts``). A persist failure surfaces as a
            structured ``ToolResult(is_error=True)`` (the file is already
            written to the sandbox; only the workspace mirror failed).

    Returns:
        An :class:`AsyncTool` named ``file_write`` that creates/overwrites
        files inside the sandbox. Failures return
        ``ToolResult(is_error=True, ...)`` — never raise.
