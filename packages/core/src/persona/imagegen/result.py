"""Boundary types crossing the :class:`ImageBackend` surface (spec 15).

Frozen Pydantic v2 models with ``extra="forbid"`` per
D-15-X-pydantic-boundary-types (six-spec precedent
D-01-12 / D-02-2 / D-03-3 / D-05-9 / D-06-1 / D-13-X-now corrects spec
§4's ``@dataclass`` sketches). These shapes are returned by
:class:`persona.imagegen.protocol.ImageBackend` implementations and
consumed by the persona-api image-gen service (spec 15 T15), the audit
logger (:class:`persona.tools.audit.ToolAuditLogger`), and the HTTP
response payload (spec 15 T16).

The :class:`GeneratedImage.image_bytes` / ``workspace_path`` split is
the Phase-2-surfaced division of labour between the backend layer (which
returns raw bytes in memory) and the API service layer (which persists
the bytes to the per-persona workspace via
``persona.tools.workspace.resolve_sandbox_path`` and rewrites the model
with ``workspace_path`` populated + ``image_bytes`` zeroed for the
response envelope).
