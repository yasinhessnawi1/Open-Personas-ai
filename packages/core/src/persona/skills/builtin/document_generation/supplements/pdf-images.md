# PDF Generation — Images and embedded charts (detailed reference)

Verbose reference for embedding PNG / JPEG images in reportlab PDFs,
including the Spec 17 chart-embedding contract. Read from inside your
code:

```python
from pathlib import Path
detail = Path(
    "/workspace/in/.skills/pdf_generation/supplements/images.md"
).read_text()
```

## Supported formats

`reportlab.platypus.Image` accepts the formats Python Imaging Library
(PIL / Pillow) decodes — primarily PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF. **SVG is
not supported** by the `Image` flowable at reportlab 4.2.5; it would
require `svglib`, which is not in the Spec 12 sandbox image manifest
(see Spec 16 D-16-5-rejection-SVG for the rationale).

**Use PNG for everything.** It is lossless, supports transparency,
embeds cleanly, and is what Spec 17 produces by default.

## The Spec 17 chart contract (D-16-5)

When Spec 17 produces a chart **in the same `code_execution` session**,
it writes it to:

```
/workspace/out/charts/<id>.png
```

`<id>` is a caller-chosen UUID or descriptive slug picked by Spec 17.
Spec 16 documents read the file via `Image(path, width=…, height=…)`:

```python
from reportlab.platypus import Image
from reportlab.lib.units import cm

chart = Image("/workspace/out/charts/complaints-by-district.png",
              width=14 * cm, height=8 * cm)
chart.hAlign = "CENTER"
story.append(chart)
```

**Same-session only.** The sandbox cleans `/workspace/out` between
`code_execution` calls (per Spec 16 state.md A2 finding). A chart Spec 17
produced on a previous turn is **not** at that path on this turn. The
SKILL.md body's failure-modes list reiterates this.

If the orchestrator enables sandbox session mode (D-12-1 scaled scope),
filesystem state persists across `docker exec` calls *within* one
session — the chart from call N is still there at call N+1 in the same
session. Across sessions, nothing persists in v0.1.

## Sizing

**Always pass `width` and `height` in cm or inch units.** Raw
`Image(path)` without sizing interprets the PNG's pixel dimensions as
points (one point = 1/72 inch) — a 1200×800 chart becomes a 16 × 11
inch flowable, which is off-page on A4.

```python
from reportlab.lib.units import cm, inch

Image(path, width=14 * cm, height=8 * cm)   # metric
Image(path, width=5 * inch, height=3 * inch)  # imperial
```

### Maintaining aspect ratio

If you only know the target width and want to preserve the source's
aspect ratio, read the source dimensions via PIL:

```python
from PIL import Image as PILImage
from reportlab.lib.units import cm
from reportlab.platypus import Image

with PILImage.open(chart_path) as im:
    src_w, src_h = im.size  # pixels

target_w_cm = 14
target_h_cm = target_w_cm * (src_h / src_w)
chart = Image(chart_path,
              width=target_w_cm * cm,
              height=target_h_cm * cm)
```

PIL is pre-installed in the Spec 12 sandbox image (it's a transitive of
both reportlab and matplotlib).

### Fitting an image to the content frame

The A4 content frame with 2 cm margins is 17 × 25.7 cm. A chart wider
than the frame is a layout failure (the right edge clips). Compute the
target size against the frame width:

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4
from reportlab.lib.units import cm

frame_w_cm = (A4[0] - 4 * cm) / cm   # ≈ 17 cm

with PILImage.open(chart_path) as im:
    src_w, src_h = im.size

# Use full frame width but cap height at 60% of frame height
target_w_cm = min(frame_w_cm, 14)
target_h_cm = target_w_cm * (src_h / src_w)
max_h_cm = (A4[1] - 4 * cm) / cm * 0.6  # ≈ 15 cm
if target_h_cm > max_h_cm:
    target_h_cm = max_h_cm
    target_w_cm = target_h_cm * (src_w / src_h)
```

This is the safe sizing pattern when you don't know the chart's
dimensions ahead of time.

## DPI guidance

For embedded charts (matplotlib output), prefer `dpi=150` or higher when
the chart is rendered. The default `plt.savefig(path)` is 100 DPI, which
prints fine but looks soft on high-resolution screens.

```python
# In the chart-producing code (or in your own pre-pass if you're
# generating both chart and PDF in one code_execution call):
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 4))  # inches
ax.plot(x, y)
fig.savefig("/workspace/out/charts/complaints.png",
            dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")
plt.close(fig)
```

`bbox_inches="tight"` trims surrounding whitespace, which keeps the
embedded image visually balanced with the surrounding text.

## Alignment

`Image` is left-aligned by default. To centre or right-align:

```python
img = Image(path, width=14 * cm, height=8 * cm)
img.hAlign = "CENTER"   # or "LEFT" / "RIGHT"
```

`vAlign` exists but is rarely useful at the flowable level — vertical
position is determined by the flow.

## Image with a caption

Wrap image + caption in a `KeepTogether` so they don't split across
pages:

```python
from reportlab.platypus import KeepTogether, Image, Paragraph, Spacer

caption_style = ParagraphStyle(
    "Caption", parent=body, fontSize=9, alignment=1, textColor=colors.grey,
)

img = Image(chart_path, width=14 * cm, height=8 * cm)
img.hAlign = "CENTER"
caption = Paragraph(
    "<i>Figure 1.</i> Complaints by district, Q1 2026.", caption_style,
)
story.append(KeepTogether([img, Spacer(1, 0.2 * cm), caption]))
```

## Images inside table cells

`Image` flowables can be cells in a `Table` or `LongTable`:

```python
data = [
    ["District", "Trend chart"],
    ["Sentrum", Image(sentrum_chart, width=4 * cm, height=2 * cm)],
    ["Grünerløkka", Image(grun_chart, width=4 * cm, height=2 * cm)],
]
```

Use small target sizes — table cells get cramped quickly. Match the row
height implied by the image to the column widths you set.

## Backgrounds and watermarks

For a watermark image on every page, draw it in the page callback (not
as a flowable):

```python
def _watermark(canvas, doc) -> None:
    canvas.saveState()
    canvas.setFillAlpha(0.05)
    canvas.drawImage("/workspace/in/.skills/pdf_generation/assets/wm.png",
                     x=A4[0] / 2 - 8 * cm, y=A4[1] / 2 - 8 * cm,
                     width=16 * cm, height=16 * cm,
                     preserveAspectRatio=True, mask="auto")
    canvas.restoreState()
```

`canvas.drawImage(...)` (not the `Image` flowable) is the low-level
call. `mask="auto"` honours transparency in the source PNG.

## Common mistakes

1. **`Image(path)` without size.** Renders pixel-as-point. Always pass
   `width=` and `height=` in cm or inch.

2. **Aspect-ratio drift.** Setting both `width` and `height` without
   reading the source dimensions distorts the image. Use PIL to read
   the source size and compute one dimension from the other.

3. **Embedding a chart from a different `code_execution` call.** The
   `/workspace/out/` directory is cleaned between executions. The chart
   does not survive — produce the chart in the same call as the PDF, or
   use session mode if the orchestrator enables it.

4. **JPEG with transparency expected.** JPEG does not support an alpha
   channel; transparent regions render as solid white. Use PNG for any
   image with transparency.

5. **A chart that exceeds the page frame.** Width 18 cm on an A4 page
   with 2 cm margins clips the right edge. Cap at frame width (≈ 17
   cm).

6. **Drawing into the canvas after `build()` returns.** The canvas is
   closed at the end of `build()`. Any drawing must happen in a flowable
   or in the page callback during the build, not after.

7. **Forgetting `plt.close(fig)`** when producing many charts in a loop.
   Matplotlib keeps figures alive in memory until closed; long loops
   leak memory.
