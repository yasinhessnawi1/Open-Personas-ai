"""SkillInjector — enforces the 2000-token-per-turn skill content budget (T06).

When the runtime activates a skill (via the synthetic ``use_skill`` tool,
T07), the prompt builder calls :meth:`SkillInjector.inject` to get the
content to splice into the next turn's system prompt.

Three branches per D-04-7 + D-04-8:

1. ``skill.content_token_count <= TOKEN_BUDGET`` → return ``skill.content``
   verbatim. The common case for well-authored skills.
2. Over budget, a ``summariser`` was injected → ``await summariser(content)``.
   If the summary is still over budget (defensive — small-tier might be
   noisy), fall through to truncation.
3. Over budget, no summariser → token-aware truncation via binary search
   on character index; result ends with the ``MARKER`` literal.

The injector is **single-skill per call**. The "only one skill per turn"
rule (spec §7.1) is policy enforced by the runtime, not the injector — the
injector is stateless and has no concept of turns.

``TOKEN_BUDGET = 2000`` is a class constant, NOT env-overridable in v0.1
(D-04-7; architecture §5.1.2 "non-negotiable"). The runtime can pass a
different value at call time only via subclassing or direct constant
rebinding, both of which would be code changes, not configuration.

Token-aware truncation (D-04-8) uses **ceil-bisection** on character index;
``mid = (lo + hi + 1) // 2`` avoids the infinite loop at ``lo == hi - 1``
that floor-bisection produces.
