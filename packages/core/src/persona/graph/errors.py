"""Domain exceptions raised by the knowledge-graph store (Spec K0).

A small family under an intermediate :class:`GraphError` parent — introduced
here because K0 lands four leaf subclasses at once (the D-03-1 convention:
add the intermediate parent when the fourth subclass arrives, so callers can
catch all graph failures with one ``except GraphError``). All carry the
standard ``context: dict[str, str]`` keyword so log lines + audit events get
structured data.

    The deterministic resolver returns a three-way verdict

    reserved for genuinely-broken inputs (e.g. a mention with no usable

    Covers the unrecoverable merge cases: an extend target that vanished
    mid-operation, a contradiction/update with no resolvable prior version,
    or a candidate that fails the boundary schema. Conservative-by-default

    Covers an index add/replace/remove that cannot keep the same-path sync

    an allowlist/search-kernel failure. The pgvector and turbovec adapters
    both raise this at their boundary so callers depend on the domain type,
