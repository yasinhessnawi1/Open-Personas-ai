"""The knowledge-graph ports — ``GraphStore`` / ``GraphIndex`` / ``EntityRegistry`` (Spec K0, T2).

These are the seams the later tasks fill (T3 transport, T5 registry, T7 index
adapters, T8 store) and that **K1 (hybrid retrieval) and K2 (write paths) build
on**. The shapes are designed to anticipate K1+K2, not merely to pass K0's own
criteria — the K-track lives or dies on getting them right.

**Scope binding (CSA-1 / D-14-X-scope-binding-discipline).** The graph is
*user*-scoped. Every store/registry method takes ``owner_id`` as its first
parameter — the scope identifier passed into the call slot, exactly as
``MemoryStore.write(persona_id, …)`` does. The parameter name is NOT a rename of
``persona_id``; it is the user-scope analogue. No Protocol fork: these are *new*
ports for a new store type, but they keep the single-Protocol calling convention.

**The durable string id is the identity; the surrogate is the index key.**
``GraphStore`` speaks in durable string node-ids (``ConceptNode.id``, the K1/K5
contract). ``GraphIndex`` speaks in ``uint64`` **surrogates** (D-K0-3) — the
store maps between them. Surrogates never escape into K1/K2/K5.
