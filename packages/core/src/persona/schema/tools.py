"""Tool protocol and call/result types — definitions only.

Spec 03 ships the concrete tools (web_search, web_fetch, file_*, MCP client).
Spec 01 ships only the minimum surface so callers can type against the
protocol and the YAML allow-list can reference tool names that exist.

Design notes:
- ``Tool`` is a Protocol (PEP 544) marked ``@runtime_checkable`` so the
  toolbox can answer ``isinstance(obj, Tool)`` at registration time.
- The surface is deliberately small (``name``, ``description``,
  ``parameters_schema``, ``__call__``). Spec 03 adds decorators, registry,
  sandboxing, and async variants without breaking this protocol.
- ``ToolCall`` and ``ToolResult`` are frozen Pydantic models so they cross
  the runtime boundary cleanly (the model emits structured tool calls; the
  toolbox produces structured results).
