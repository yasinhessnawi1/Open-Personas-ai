"""The :class:`CodeSandbox` Protocol — sandbox execution contract (spec 12 T02).

Defines the structural contract every sandbox backend satisfies:

- :class:`LocalDockerSandbox` (T05a/b/c, behind a ``[sandbox]`` extra in
  ``pyproject.toml``) — runs on the user's machine for the open-source CLI.
- ``HostedSandbox`` (T08, in ``persona-api``) — runs against the E2B
  managed substrate per D-12-12 (provisional; locks after the five
  Phase-5 acceptance gates measured at T08-T11).

Both backends are duck-typed via Protocol structural subtyping. The
runtime and the agentic loop never import a concrete backend — they
depend on this Protocol and the composition root wires the appropriate
implementation (D-04-10 ``use_skill`` precedent; D-08 composition-root
pattern carried).

**Two cross-cutting decisions are encoded directly in the Protocol shape:**

- **D-12-4** ``NetworkPolicy`` is **not** a parameter of
  :meth:`CodeSandbox.execute` — it's bound at :meth:`CodeSandbox.create_session`
  time from the persona's YAML. Stateless one-shots (``session_id=None``) take
  the policy on ``execute()`` because there's no session to bind it to; the
  T03 tool factory always constructs the policy from the persona, never from
  model-supplied tool-call arguments.
- **D-12-7** :meth:`CodeSandbox.aclose` is **explicit** on the Protocol —
  every implementer ships lifecycle teardown so the composition root can
  reap warm pools (T09) and substrate-side state symmetrically. Forgetting
  it on a paid managed substrate is a continuous-billing leak (kickoff
  trip-up #7). Differs from spec-05 D-05-4 (which duck-typed
  :meth:`TierRegistry` backend cleanup because not every backend has
  lifecycle state — sandboxes ALL have it).

**Tenant-isolated session IDs (kickoff trip-up #6):** the runtime composes
``session_id`` as ``f"{owner_id}:{conversation_id}"`` — never bare
``conversation_id`` — so a different tenant with a colliding
``conversation_id`` cannot share session state. The Protocol takes
``session_id`` opaque; tenant-prefixing is the *caller's* invariant.

    Two execution modes:

    - **Stateless one-shot** — ``session_id=None`` on :meth:`execute`. The

      and destroys the sandbox. No state survives.
    - **Stateful kernel-style session** — a session is created via
      :meth:`create_session`; subsequent :meth:`execute` calls with the same
      ``session_id`` share interpreter state (variables, imports, open files)

                ``limits.wall_clock_s`` is the session-wide ceiling). The

            limits: Resource caps (CPU / memory / disk / stdout / produced

                this is ignored — :meth:`create_session` binds the policy

            persona.sandbox.errors.CodeSandboxError: Backend internal
