"""The ``code_execution`` first-class tool factory (spec 12 T03).

Wraps any :class:`CodeSandbox` into an :class:`AsyncTool` registered in the
existing :class:`Toolbox`. The persona's tool allow-list machinery (D-03-7)
gates whether a given persona can call ``code_execution`` at all; the spec-11
fix-#1 ``_dispatch`` wrappers in both loops catch ``ToolNotAllowedError`` and
:class:`SandboxError` and convert to ``ToolResult(is_error=True, ...)`` so the
SSE stream never crashes.

§9 acceptance touched by T03:
- **#1** trivial snippet round-trip — the tool's wire shape.
- **#10** large stdout truncated at ``max_stdout_bytes`` with an EXPLICIT
  marker, never dropped silently. The marker is the literal prefix
  ``[truncated: N bytes omitted]`` so a downstream consumer can recognise it
  without ambiguity. Asserted by T04's "truncated-code is recognisably
  truncated" test row.
- **#11** allow-list — the Toolbox enforces the literal-only allow-list
  unchanged (D-03-7); this factory just produces an :class:`AsyncTool` named
  ``code_execution``.
- **#13** audit emission — every execution emits exactly one
  :class:`ToolAuditEvent` with ``action="execute"`` (D-12-8); ``metadata``
  carries ``code`` (truncated to 4 KiB with the same marker), ``code_sha256``
  (full-fidelity reference), ``outcome``, ``duration_ms``, ``exit_status``.

Decisions exercised:
- **D-12-4**: ``NetworkPolicy`` is constructed by the factory FROM the persona,
  not passed by the model in the tool call. The model only supplies ``code``.
- **D-12-1**: ``session_id`` is provided by an injected ``session_id_provider``
  callable that the composition root (T10) sets per-conversation (tenant-
  isolated as ``f"{owner_id}:{conversation_id}"``; kickoff trip-up #6).
  Default returns ``None`` → stateless one-shot.
- **D-12-6**: ``SandboxError`` family is caught and converted to
  ``ToolResult(is_error=True, ...)`` — the loops' ``_dispatch`` wrappers also
  catch as a second line of defence (spec-11 fix #1 discipline).
- **D-12-8**: Audit emits even on failure (the audit trail is the forensic
  record of what was attempted, not just what succeeded). Failed-write
  pattern (D-03-21) is the contrast — we audit *all* executions.
- **D-12-14**: :class:`ExecutionResult` is Pydantic-frozen; tool factory reads
  fields via attribute access.

    """Build the ``code_execution`` :class:`AsyncTool`.

    Args:
        sandbox: The :class:`CodeSandbox` implementation to dispatch to —
            :class:`LocalDockerSandbox` (T05) for the CLI / open-source path;
            ``HostedSandbox`` (T08) for the hosted path.
        network_policy: Per-persona network policy (D-12-4 — constructed by
            the caller from the persona's YAML, never passed by the model).
            ``None`` defaults to ``NetworkPolicy()`` (egress disabled).
        resource_limits: Per-persona resource caps. ``None`` defaults to
            :class:`ResourceLimits` (sensible conservative defaults from
            spec §4.1).
        audit_logger: Optional :class:`ToolAuditLogger`. When provided, every
            execution emits one :class:`ToolAuditEvent` with
            ``action="execute"`` (D-12-8 / acceptance §9 #13).
        persona_id: Persona identifier for audit records. ``None`` for CLI
            development; audit lines then route to ``_cli.tools.jsonl``.
        session_id_provider: Callable returning the current conversation's
            session_id (tenant-isolated as ``f"{owner_id}:{conversation_id}"``
            per kickoff trip-up #6). ``None`` ⇒ stateless one-shot execution.
            Defaults to ``lambda: None`` if not supplied. Resolved lazily on
            every dispatch — supports composition roots that use contextvars
            for per-request session state (D-08-1 pattern).
        pre_execute_hook: Async hook awaited BEFORE the substrate call. The api
            wires this to ``pool.acquire(...)`` so the per-tenant sandbox session
            is lazy-eager-acquired on first dispatch (D-12-17: warm=0;
            substrate cold-start paid here, not at conversation creation).
            Hook may raise :class:`SandboxError` — caught by the same path as
            substrate failures and surfaced to the model as a structured
            ``ToolResult(is_error=True)``. ``None`` ⇒ no prelude (CLI / tests).
        on_execute_success: Async hook fired AFTER a successful execute
            (``result.outcome == "ok"``) and BEFORE the tool's :class:`ToolResult`
            is returned. The api wires this to the **flat per-execution credits
            deduction** per **D-12-3** (mirrors D-08-6: only successful executions
            are billed; OOM/timeout/killed are not). Hook exceptions are caught
            and logged so a credits-write failure cannot break the tool's result.
            ``None`` ⇒ no hook (CLI path; tests that don't exercise billing).
        produced_file_persister: Async callable ``(session_id, ref) ->
            workspace_ref | None`` invoked AFTER execute for each entry in
            ``result.produced_files``. The api wires this to a closure that
            calls :meth:`CodeSandbox.copy_produced_file_to` with a destination
            under the persona workspace (``D-17-X-bytes-persistence``) and
            **returns the resulting workspace-relative ref** (Spec 28
            D-28-X-sandbox-consolidation-scope) so the tool can surface each
            persisted file as a :class:`PersistedArtifact` on
            :attr:`ToolResult.artifacts` — the OUTPUT shape is unified with the
            bytes-persister tools; the file-copy mechanism is unchanged. Fires
            for every produced file regardless of outcome (partial-success runs
            may still produce charts before erroring). ``ProducedFileSizeError``
            propagates and is caught by the ``SandboxError`` catch-and-convert
            path above — the model sees a structured error explaining the cap
            and can produce a smaller file. A ``None`` return ⇒ that file was
            not surfaced as an artifact (still persisted). ``None`` callback ⇒
            no persistence (CLI / tests that don't need the bytes outside the
            sandbox).
        description: Tool description fed to the model. The default covers
            the spec §6 wording; override to surface persona-specific guidance.

    Returns:
        An :class:`AsyncTool` named ``code_execution`` registered against the
        provided sandbox. The model supplies only ``code: str`` — every other
        parameter (session, policy, limits) is bound at factory time.

    Notes:
        The returned tool follows the @tool / Toolbox contract unchanged:
        argument-validation errors and body-raised exceptions are converted
        to ``ToolResult(is_error=True, ...)`` by the ``@tool`` decorator
        (D-03-5). :class:`SandboxError` subclasses (D-12-6 family) are caught
        here at the body and surfaced as structured failure results so the
        model can recover (kickoff trip-up: ``SandboxUnavailableError`` =
        "Docker not available" → model explains to user). The conversation /
        agentic loops' ``_dispatch`` wrappers catch any escape as a second
        line of defence (spec-11 fix #1).
