"""Domain exceptions for the code-execution sandbox (spec 12 T01).

Per **D-12-6**, ``SandboxError`` is an **intermediate parent** under
:class:`persona.errors.PersonaError`. Spec 12 ships four cohesive subtypes
together (``CodeSandboxError``, ``ExecutionTimeoutError``, ``ResourceLimitError``,
``SandboxUnavailableError``) — D-03-1's "introduce parent only when a third
lands" condition is met. The parent makes ``except SandboxError`` ergonomic
in both loops' ``_dispatch`` wrappers without listing every leaf.

Each leaf carries ``context: dict[str, str]`` (inherited from
:class:`persona.errors.PersonaError`) so log messages are structured.

Catch-and-convert pattern (carries from spec-11 fix #1, spec-03 D-03-3):
both the conversation loop's ``_dispatch`` and the agentic loop's
``_dispatch`` already catch ``ToolNotAllowedError`` / ``ToolExecutionError``
and convert to ``ToolResult(is_error=True, ...)``. They will be widened in T03
to also catch ``SandboxError`` so an unreachable Docker daemon or substrate
outage surfaces to the model as a structured tool failure it can recover
from, never as a crashed SSE stream.
