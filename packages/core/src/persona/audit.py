"""Append-only audit log of every store mutation.

Separate from the app log (``persona.logging``). The app log is for humans
debugging; the audit log is the durable record of *who did what, when, why*.
Every store mutation (``write``, ``delete``, ``remove_documents``,
``rollback``) emits exactly one :class:`AuditEvent` via an injected
:class:`AuditLogger`. Per D-01-6 the default backend is
:class:`JSONLAuditLogger`, one file per persona at
``<audit_root>/<persona_id>.jsonl``.

The Postgres-backed audit log in spec 07 swaps in behind this protocol.
