# Open Persona — LiveKit SFU entrypoint for Fly.io (app: open-persona-livekit).
#
# The Fly-specific glue the static livekit.yaml can't express (see
# docs/research/livekit_selfhost_fly.md):
#   1. Resolve the browser-reachable public IP and pass it as --node-ip, so the
#      advertised ICE candidate is the address the browser actually hits.
#   2. Exec livekit-server with the baked config.
#
# Keys: livekit-server reads the LIVEKIT_KEYS env var directly (the built-in
# --keys flag), so we do NOT write a key_file — we just assert the secret is set.
# Format: "apiKey: secret" (the SAME pair the voice service signs tokens with).
#
# Bind: --bind makes livekit-server listen on the given address (overrides the
# config's bind_addresses for ALL listeners). Fly REQUIRES UDP listeners to bind
# to `fly-global-services` (binding 0.0.0.0 makes Linux pick the wrong source
# address on UDP replies). `fly-global-services` resolves to the VM's reachable
# address, so TCP/HTTP signaling works on it too — one bind satisfies both.
# OPERATOR-PASS CHECK: if signaling (wss) fails to connect after deploy, the
# fallback is to drop --bind entirely (LiveKit defaults to 0.0.0.0 for TCP) and
# rely on --node-ip alone for the UDP candidate, the pattern the community Fly
# example used. See docs/research/livekit_selfhost_fly.md §1.3.
#
# Fail-fast: a missing precondition aborts the boot rather than coming up broken.

# reaches. Verify this on the live VM during the operator pass (see runbook).

# --- launch -------------------------------------------------------------------
# --keys is read from $LIVEKIT_KEYS automatically; we pass --config, --node-ip,
# and bind to Fly's required address (satisfies UDP; TCP works on it too).
# The official livekit/livekit-server image ships the binary at /livekit-server
# (its ENTRYPOINT) — it is NOT on PATH, so call it by absolute path (bare
# `livekit-server` exits 127 "command not found").
#
# NO global --bind: it would override ALL listeners (incl. HTTP/7880) to
# fly-global-services and make signaling unreachable to the Fly proxy. The bind
# split lives in livekit.yaml: top-level bind_addresses=0.0.0.0 (HTTP) +
# rtc.bind_addresses=fly-global-services (media UDP/TCP).
