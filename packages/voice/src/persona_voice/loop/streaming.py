"""Streaming-loop skeleton — the four named Protocol seams + the pass-through echo default.

D-V1-X-loop-skeleton-shape locks the async-generator pattern + dual-priority
queue (Pipecat InterruptionFrame discipline; R-V1-5 finding #5). Each seam
is a :class:`typing.Protocol` so V2 / V3 / V4 / V5 implementing agents can
satisfy it with provider-specific adapters without a base class. V1 owns the
plumbing; the seams stay provider-independent (R-V1-5 lean — "adopt the
seam shape, reject the SDK coupling").

The seams:

* **V2 — :class:`STTStream`**: push model. ``push_audio(pcm, sample_rate)``
  ingests inbound frames; ``transcripts()`` yields :class:`Transcript`
  records (``is_final``, ``text``, ``confidence``, ``eou_at``).
* **V3 — :class:`TTSStream`**: ``synthesize(text_stream)`` consumes an
  ``AsyncIterator[str]`` (LLM token stream) and yields
  :class:`AudioChunk` records. ``cancel()`` aborts in-flight synthesis
  (barge-in path — T08 binary criterion).
* **V4 — :class:`SessionEventListener`** (defined in
  :mod:`persona_voice.session.state_machine`): dual-priority queue dispatches
  ``UserStartedSpeaking`` / ``Interruption`` / ``EndOfTurn`` events on the
  SYSTEM priority lane so they bypass the audio data lane.
* **V5 — :class:`ModelReplyProducer`**: an async-callable producing
  ``AsyncIterator[str]`` tokens from a final-transcript trigger; never a
  blocking ``complete()`` call. The streaming-everywhere discipline
  (R-V1-3) hinges on V5 emitting tokens incrementally so V3 TTS can start
  audio before the LLM finishes — compresses additive latency into max().

The :class:`StreamingLoop` runs the streaming pipeline:

1. Inbound audio frames from :class:`VoiceRoom` arrive at
   :meth:`StreamingLoop._on_inbound_frame`.
2. If a :class:`STTStream` is wired, the frame is pushed into it; otherwise
   the loop falls back to :attr:`PassThroughEchoMode.ECHO` and pipes the
   inbound frame straight to the outbound rail (the pass-through default
   that lets T08 verify the full-duplex pipe before V2/V3/V5 wire).
3. Transcripts flow from V2 → V5; tokens flow from V5 → V3; audio chunks
   flow from V3 → :class:`VoiceRoom`'s outbound source.

Audio invariants (D-V1-6) are enforced at the seam boundary: inbound PCM16
mono 16 kHz; outbound PCM16 mono 24 kHz. Every audio-bearing record carries
its ``sample_rate`` explicitly so the sample-rate-mismatch bug R-V1-5 names
("the #1 production bug per AssemblyAI debugging guide") is structurally
impossible.
