"""Durable call-record writer (Spec V9, V9-D-5; T3).

A voice call's lifecycle envelope — when it started, when it ended, how long it
ran, and why it stopped — was persisted NOWHERE server-side before V9 (it lived
only in the in-memory :class:`~persona_voice.session.state_machine.Session` and
client storage). :class:`CallRecorder` writes it to the api-owned ``calls``
table, making each finished call a durable, browsable record (the Calls-surface
membership key, V9-D-3).

The voice runtime is **API-free** (``voice → runtime → core``, never
persona-api), so the recorder writes through core's own ``calls`` Table view
(:data:`persona.calls.calls`) on the session's RLS engine — the ``memory_chunks``
P2 precedent, no persona-api import. The owner-scoped RLS ``WITH CHECK`` is
satisfied because that engine sets ``app.current_user_id`` per connection and
``owner_id`` is the session's user.

Both writes are **best-effort** (mirrors the episodic write in
:mod:`persona_voice.model.memory`): they MUST NOT raise — a failed call-record
write degrades the Calls entry, never the call itself. :meth:`open` runs once
when the call goes active; :meth:`close` once at teardown (any reason).
