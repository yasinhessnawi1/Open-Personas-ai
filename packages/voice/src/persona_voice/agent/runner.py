"""The voice agent-worker — the composition-root runner (spec V6 A0).

V1–V5 built every voice component + seam, but never the deployable process that
**is the persona on a call**: ``wire_orchestrated_loop`` / ``build_voice_room``
were referenced only by tests (fakes at the transport boundary), and the V5
operator pass explicitly DEFER-NOTE'd the WebRTC mic→speaker leg "to the live-
audio leg" — i.e. to V6. This module is that missing glue: it assembles the
already-built collaborators into a running process that joins a real LiveKit
Room, runs the streaming loop, and tears down on disconnect.

**Scope (D-V6-X-agent-worker, binding).** This is the **minimal, single-session,
dev/operator-pass-grade** runner — enough to make one real browser call work
against the dev LiveKit sidecar with real keys. Production worker-ops (a
multi-session supervisor, autoscaling, room-agent dispatch) and the prod worker
deploy are explicit forward-items, the same tier as the prod-LiveKit-deploy
forward-item. This module spawns no pool, matches no dispatch, scales nothing —
one call, one session, one ``run()``.

**Layering.** persona-voice → persona-runtime → persona-core. This runner imports
``persona.*`` + ``persona_runtime.*`` directly (the V5 workspace edge) and never
``persona_api.*`` — the persona is loaded from the DB with a raw RLS-scoped
``SELECT`` (the persona-api ``RuntimeFactory._load_persona`` shape, reproduced
here so no api dependency is taken).

**The testable seam.** :func:`build_agent_session` does the heavy real assembly
(STT/TTS/model/stores/room); :class:`AgentSession` owns the connect→run→teardown
lifecycle. The lifecycle is unit-tested with fully-faked parts (so STT/TTS/DB
internals — already covered by V2–V5 — are not re-exercised); the real assembly
is exercised live by the V6 operator pass (D2).
