"""VoiceRoom: the LiveKit Room facade persona-voice's agent worker uses.

The agent worker joins a LiveKit Room as a participant via the access token
T04 mints (room name + identity + persona/conversation metadata). LiveKit
Server handles Opus encode/decode, jitter buffer, STUN/TURN traversal, ICE
negotiation, and DTLS-SRTP encryption — none of that is persona-voice's
concern (D-V1-1 branch (A)).

What persona-voice DOES own:

1. **Subscribing to the user's inbound audio track.** LiveKit fires
   ``track_subscribed`` when an audio publication arrives; this facade wraps
   that into a :class:`AudioStream` and drains frames into a registered
   :data:`InboundAudioHandler` callback (T07 V2 seam consumer).
2. **Publishing the persona's outbound audio track.** A custom
   :class:`AudioSource` is created at construction time and a local audio
   track wrapping it is published when :meth:`VoiceRoom.publish_outbound`
   runs. T07's V3 seam consumer feeds the source via
   :meth:`VoiceRoom.capture_outbound_frame`.
3. **Connection lifecycle events.** ``connected`` / ``disconnected`` /
   ``participant_disconnected`` callbacks bubble up to T06's session state
   machine.

The :class:`RoomSubstrate` Protocol abstracts the subset of
``livekit.rtc.Room`` we depend on so unit tests can inject a fake substrate
without spinning up a LiveKit Server. Production wires the real
``rtc.Room`` via :func:`build_voice_room`.

Audio invariants (D-V1-6): PCM16 mono **16 kHz** on the inbound rail (the
form V2 STT expects), PCM16 mono **24 kHz** on the outbound rail (the form V3
TTS produces). Sample-rate conversion happens at this boundary; the loop
skeleton (T07) never touches a non-canonical rate.
