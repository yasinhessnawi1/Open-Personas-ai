"""ConversationalOrchestrator — the state-machine driver (spec V4 T04).

This is where the pure decision policies (T02 controller, T03 detector) and
the state vocabulary (T01) become a live conversation. The orchestrator:

* holds the current :class:`ConversationalState`;
* consumes V2's speech-activity signal (it IS a
  :class:`persona_voice.stt.protocol.SpeechActivityListener`) and V2's
  transcripts;
* runs the two judgement surfaces (turn-taking + barge-in) at the right
  moments and drives the guarded state transitions;
* performs the turn actions (invoke / cancel / interrupt) through an injected
  :class:`TurnActions` seam (T06 backs it with the V1 ``StreamingLoop``);
* broadcasts every transition on a :class:`ConversationalStateListener` seam
  (V6 renders it);
* owns the agent-speaking mute-window provider V2's VAD adapter consumes
  (D-V2-X-echo-cancellation) — :meth:`is_agent_speaking`.

**Timing is injected, not wall-clock-bound.** The two time-delayed decisions
— turn-end (after the silence threshold) and barge-in confirmation (after the
confirm window) — are scheduled through a :class:`Scheduler` seam and timed
with an injected ``clock``. The default scheduler wraps ``asyncio``; tests
inject a deterministic fake. This keeps the orchestrator's wiring exhaustively
unit-testable (the spec's whole point — the parameters are tuned, so the
machinery around them must be testable without real time).
