"""Unified voice→episodic memory write (spec V5 T8; D-V5-X-memory-write-on-commit).

A voice call is a conversation in the *same* model as a text chat (Spec 01/07):
its turns are written to the *same* episodic store, so something said by voice is
remembered when the user next types, and vice versa (criterion 3 — one continuous
persona, no separate voice store).

The write is **on commit only** (D-V5-X-memory-write-on-commit, the cancel↔write
race fix): V4's loop emits the per-turn ``HeardReply`` in its ``finally`` *after*
barge-in cancellation resolves, which the ``HeardWordsBridge`` adapts to a
:class:`~persona_voice.turn_taking.heard_words.BargedReply` and forwards to this
listener's :meth:`on_reply_committed`. So memory records what was *heard*
(truncated-as-heard on a barge-in), never what was *planned* (D-V4-4) — race-safe
by construction, because there is never a speculative mid-stream write.

The user side of the turn is correlated by turn key: the
:class:`~persona_voice.model.reply_producer.VoiceModelReplyProducer` calls
:meth:`note_user_message` with the transcribed user turn at generation start; the
matching :meth:`on_reply_committed` pairs it with the heard reply into one
combined episodic chunk (the same ``USER:…/ASSISTANT:…`` shape the text loop
writes — unified memory).

History compaction is scheduled here, in the inter-turn gap after the turn is
recorded — off the user-stops→persona-starts critical path (D-V5-3).
