"""Durable transcript writer — voice turns → the ``messages`` table (V9-D-1/D-2).

Before V9 a spoken turn reached only the persona-scoped episodic store
(``memory_chunks`` — no ``conversation_id``, so a per-call transcript can't be
grouped from it, V9-D-1) and the in-memory history (lost at teardown). It never
reached ``messages``, so a call left an EMPTY conversation under D-V7-7's
``/chat/{id}`` recap. :class:`VoiceTranscriptWriter` closes that gap: it persists
each committed turn (user STT + persona heard text) as real ``messages`` rows,
**byte-for-byte identical to a finalized chat turn** (V9-D-2) so the transcript
renders under the same thread/recap UI with no voice special-casing.

API-free: writes the api-owned ``messages`` table through core's own ``messages``
view (:data:`persona.transcript.messages`) on the session RLS engine — the
``memory_chunks`` / ``calls`` P2 precedent, no persona-api import. The write is
**best-effort** (mirrors the episodic write in :mod:`persona_voice.model.memory`,
which runs in V4's ``finally``): it MUST NOT raise — a transcript-write failure
degrades the saved transcript, never the live call.
