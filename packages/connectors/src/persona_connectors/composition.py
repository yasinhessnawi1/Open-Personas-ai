"""The connector-service composition root (Spec C1 T1, C1-D-1).

This is the **single api-coupled module** in persona-connectors. Per C1-D-1 the
connector reuses persona-api's reply-producing chat flow + C0's delivery router
in-process, following the ``run_worker.py`` pattern — a separate long-lived
process that imports api services and sets the ``current_user_id`` RLS contextvar
per unit of work, outside any FastAPI request scope. Concentrating the
``persona_api`` import here keeps the owned surface (:mod:`persona_connectors.domain`)
import-decoupled, so a future extract-to-core is a dependency swap, not a reshape
(the reversibility guarantee).

T1 wires the **shared foundations** every later task needs: the edition switch,
the RLS engine, and the owner-scope (D-C1-X-rls-spine). The delivery-router
(C0 ``DeliveryRouter`` reuse, T10) and the conversation-loop builder (api's
``RuntimeFactory``, T9) plug in here in their tasks — their seams are marked
below.
