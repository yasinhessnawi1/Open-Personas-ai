"""The Discord connector's ASGI app (Spec C3) — the OAuth issue + callback routes.

Discord's inbound is the gateway (a WebSocket, a later ⛔ task), so the only HTTP the
adapter serves is the OAuth account-linking carrier — two routes, both api-free (every
dependency injected, so the composition root wires the api-coupled bits):

- ``POST /v1/connectors/discord/link`` — the authenticated linking issue route. **The
  owner is derived from the verified Clerk JWT (the ``sub`` claim), NEVER from the
  request body/params** — otherwise anyone could mint an authorize URL binding to an
  arbitrary owner. The verified owner is handed to the injected ``issue_authorize_url``
  and the ``https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?...&state=<LinkToken>`` URL is returned.

- ``GET /discord/oauth/callback`` — the **out-of-band OAuth callback** (the binding
  WRITE). Discord redirects the user's browser here with ``code`` + ``state``; the
  injected ``complete_oauth`` exchanges the code → identity and binds it via C1's
  ``redeem_and_bind``. A tampered / replayed / expired / wrong-platform ``state`` (or a
  failed exchange) **fails closed** — a 400, no bind — never an attacker-chosen binding
  (the CSRF-class boundary, D-C3-4).
