"""Shared system-reply copy for the inbound flow (Spec C3 amendment #2, D-C3-X-flow-skeleton).

The "bot speaking" replies (not a persona): the list-and-instructions first-contact
(C1-D-7, the I/O half of the C1 ``ListAndInstructions`` decision), the ``/new``
confirmations, and the no-personas edge. **Platform-neutral plain text** — no markup,
no platform branching — so every text adapter (Telegram / Discord / Slack) reuses it
verbatim; the connector sends it as plain text (system replies carry no persona tag).

Lifted from the C2 ``telegram/replies.py`` into the framework's owned surface (it was
always platform-neutral). Owned surface — api-free; stdlib only.
