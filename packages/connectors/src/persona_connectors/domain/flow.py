"""The shared inbound-flow skeleton (Spec C3 amendment #2, D-C3-X-flow-skeleton).

The platform-agnostic inbound sequence every text adapter runs — lifted from the
C2 Telegram orchestrator (``telegram/flow.py``) into the framework's owned surface
so Telegram / Discord / Slack share ONE flow and reimplement only their transport
I/O + their auth carrier. The third platform makes the thin-adapter promise literal
(criterion 10): once C1 owns the flow, each adapter is glue.

**The boundary — where surface-specific auth stays in the surface:**

- SHARED (here, :class:`SharedInboundFlow.handle_text`): resolve an *arrived*
  identity → its owner (or a link-instruction + zero access); load the owner's
  personas; the ``/new`` boundary; a greeting → list-and-instructions; route
  (:func:`~persona_connectors.domain.routing.decide_route` over
  :func:`~persona_connectors.domain.addressing.parse_addressed_persona` +
  :meth:`~persona_connectors.domain.conversation_model.ConversationStateStore.current_foreground`);
  drive the turn (foreground + the no-streaming typing window + ``run_turn`` + send).
  **The shared flow READS bindings (resolve), it NEVER creates them.**
- SURFACE-SIDE (each adapter, around/behind this): inbound ``classify`` + the
  DM-only enforcement; the non-text decline; **all linking/auth carrier** —
  Telegram's ``/start <token>`` deep-link redeem (prepended before delegating) and
  Discord/Slack's OAuth redeem (entirely out-of-band on the callback route, never in
  this flow); and the platform I/O behind :class:`FlowTransport` (``send_system`` /
  ``send_persona`` / ``typing``).

So no token / OAuth / bind concept ever crosses into this module — the auth *write*
is the surface's, the identity *read* is the framework's. The command vocabulary
(:class:`FlowCommands`) is injected, so a surface declares its own greeting word
(Telegram ``/start``; Discord/Slack none) without the flow hard-coding one platform's
convention. Owned surface — api-free.
