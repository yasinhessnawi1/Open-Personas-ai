"""The Slack connector's OAuth ASGI routes (Spec C3) — issue + callback.

The Slack adapter serves the OAuth account-linking carrier as two HTTP routes (api-free —
every dependency injected). The inbound *event* transport (socket mode / HTTP events) is a
separate ⛔ task; this is the linking carrier only.

- ``POST /v1/connectors/slack/link`` — the authenticated issue route. **The owner is
  derived from the verified Clerk JWT, NEVER from the request body/params** — so a caller
  can only mint an authorize URL binding to THEIR account.
- ``GET /slack/oauth/callback`` — the **out-of-band OAuth callback** (the binding WRITE).
  Slack redirects the browser here with ``code`` + ``state``; the injected
  ``complete_oauth`` exchanges the code → identity and binds it via C1's
  ``redeem_and_bind``. A tampered / replayed / expired / wrong-platform ``state`` (or a
  failed exchange) **fails closed** — a 400, no bind (the CSRF-class boundary, D-C3-4).

This route module is intentionally structured like ``discord/app.py``; if a third HTTP
OAuth carrier appears (C4/C5), a shared ``build_oauth_app`` is the natural extraction.
