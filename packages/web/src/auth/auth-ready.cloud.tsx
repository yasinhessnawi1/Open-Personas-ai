/**
 * Branded-auth readiness guard (Spec 34, black-screen hardening) — cloud-only.
 *
 * The Core-3 signal hooks `useSignIn()` / `useSignUp()` (`@clerk/react@6.7.2`,
 * re-exported by `@clerk/nextjs`) are TYPED as always returning a non-null
 * `signIn` / `signUp` and a populated `errors` projection. At runtime that
 * guarantee does NOT hold during the window right after sign-out, when the
 * Clerk client RESETS:
 *
 *   - `@clerk/shared`'s own `NullableSignInSignal` / `NullableSignUpSignal`
 *     types document that `signIn` / `signUp` can be `null`.
 *   - While `clerk.loaded` is true the hook returns the live clerk-js signal
 *     (not the safe `StateProxy` default), which is momentarily mid-reset so
 *     `errors` (and therefore `errors.fields`) can be `undefined`.
 *
 * The branded flow components read `errors.fields` and `signIn.*` / `signUp.*`
 * directly in render. An unguarded read in that reset window throws
 * (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fields')`), React unmounts
 * the tree, and — absent an error boundary — the whole screen goes black.
 *
 * `isAuthSignalReady` is the single source of truth for "the signal is safe to
 * read". `AuthLoading` renders the calm loading state INSIDE the brand shell so
 * the guard never shows a blank canvas. Both are pure / presentational and
 * never import `@clerk/*`, so the file is cloud-scoped by name only.
