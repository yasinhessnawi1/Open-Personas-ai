 * `@/auth/provider`, and `@/auth/middleware`. The `cloud` variant is Clerk; the
 * `community` variant is a no-auth stub (fixed local owner). The edition is
 * selected at BUILD time via `turbopack.resolveAlias` keyed on `PERSONA_EDITION`
 * (next.config.ts), so a community build never pulls `@clerk/*` into the bundle.
 *
 * Both variants conform to the types here so call sites are edition-agnostic.
