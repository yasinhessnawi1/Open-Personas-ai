// Spec 33 (D-33-2): the auth layer is edition-selected at BUILD time. Build is
// Turbopack (Next 16), so the swap is `turbopack.resolveAlias` (a webpack alias
// would break `next build`). `@/auth*` resolves to the edition's variant; a
// `community` build never pulls `@clerk/*` into the module graph. Default is
// `community` (the product default, D-33-1); the cloud deploy sets
// `PERSONA_EDITION=cloud`. The tsconfig `paths` point at the cloud variants so
// the type-checker / tests resolve `@/auth` to the richer Clerk surface.
//
// The alias TARGET is the `@/auth/<variant>` specifier (not an absolute or `./`
// filesystem path): Turbopack 16.2 rejects an absolute resolveAlias target as a
// "server relative import (not implemented yet)" and does not resolve a bare
// relative `./src/...` target from the project root. Routing through the `@/*`
// tsconfig path lets Turbopack's own resolver land on the variant file.

// Clerk Production Frontend API host. When the production instance is set up

// first-party on `app.<root>`), Clerk's client tries to load its JS bundle and
// reach its API via `<current-host>/__clerk/*`. Without an edge rewrite, those
// paths 404 on Vercel. We rewrite them server-side to Clerk's actual CDN.
//
// The host is read from a build-time env var so dev / preview / production each
// pick up the right CDN. Default falls back to the public path (Clerk's own
// shared CDN) so local + Preview builds without the var still work.
